Customer: Yes, it’s Daniel Roberts.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Roberts. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 9th August 1991, and my postcode is NG1 2AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I just noticed several payments leaving my account that I didn’t authorize. My mobile banking app looks strange too—it’s showing a notification I don’t recognize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear this, Mr. Roberts. Let me assure you, we’ll look into this thoroughly. To begin, can you describe the suspicious activity you noticed in the app?

Customer: There were five payments I didn’t make—three for £500 each and two for £1,000. I also saw a pop-up earlier asking me to “reverify” my banking details. I think I might have entered my password there.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. That pop-up could be part of a phishing attempt. Did the app redirect you to any external pages or ask for additional information, such as a one-time passcode?

Customer: Yes, it asked for my passcode, and I entered it. I didn’t think anything of it at the time because it looked official.

Advisor: Understood. Let me review your account for unauthorized activity and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Roberts. I’ve identified five unauthorized payments totaling £3,000, just as you described. I’ve also found evidence of multiple unauthorized devices accessing your account. It seems your mobile banking credentials have been compromised. Have you installed any new apps or clicked on any unusual links recently?

Customer: Yes, I downloaded a budgeting app last week, and I think it might have been from an unofficial website. Could that be the issue?

Advisor: That’s very likely. Fraudsters often use fake apps to gain access to banking details. I’ll block further transactions from your account and reset your mobile banking credentials immediately. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 7821.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll secure your account now. While I’m doing that, let’s discuss further steps to recover your funds and protect your information. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: First, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for follow-up.

Customer: I’ll contact them after this call. Can the payments be reversed?

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions for investigation, and we’ll work with the receiving banks to attempt recovery. While we can’t guarantee success, we’ll keep you updated throughout the process.

Customer: Thank you. What else should I do to secure my account?

Advisor: Let’s enable two-factor authentication for your mobile banking app to add an extra layer of protection. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in the follow-up email. Additionally, I recommend changing the passwords for your email and any other accounts where you’ve used the same credentials. Do you use unique passwords for each account?

Customer: No, I’ve reused the same password for a few accounts.

Advisor: I’ll include guidance on creating secure, unique passwords and suggest using a password manager. It’s also important to monitor your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been exposed. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: Let’s also discuss recognizing phishing attempts and securing your mobile devices. Fraudsters often target banking customers through fake apps or malicious links. Always download apps from official app stores and verify their authenticity before installation. Did the budgeting app you downloaded have any reviews or other indicators of legitimacy?

Customer: No, I didn’t check. It seemed fine at first glance.

Advisor: It’s an easy mistake to make. I’ll provide tips in the follow-up email on how to verify app authenticity and avoid similar issues in the future. Additionally, consider installing antivirus software on your phone to detect malicious activity.

Customer: That’s a good idea. I’ll look into that.

Advisor: Before we wrap up, let me summarize the steps we’ve taken today. I’ve secured your account by resetting your credentials and blocking further unauthorized transactions. I’ve flagged the fraudulent payments for investigation and recommended reporting the incident to Action Fraud. I’ve also advised enabling two-factor authentication, updating your passwords, and monitoring your credit report. Finally, I’ll send guidance on verifying apps, recognizing phishing attempts, and securing your mobile devices. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Roberts. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have any further concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
