David Clarke contacted [Bank Name]’s Fraud Department after falling victim to multiple scams, resulting in unauthorized transactions totaling £44,500. He explained that he had been involved in a cryptocurrency investment, a fraudulent call from someone claiming to be from the bank, and unrecognized payments from his account.

The cryptocurrency scam began with a social media advertisement. David initially invested £5,000, followed by £10,000 for a "premium account," but was later asked to pay a £2,500 "release fee" when attempting to withdraw. Separately, he received a call from someone claiming to be from the bank’s fraud team, convincing him to transfer £20,000 to a "secure account" and share his banking login credentials. Finally, David noticed two unauthorized payments—£4,000 and £3,000—on his account.

The advisor identified the fraudulent transactions and flagged them for investigation. They noted overseas login attempts to David’s online banking account, likely enabled by the shared passcodes. To secure the account, they reset his banking credentials and blocked further transactions.

To assist recovery, the advisor initiated disputes for the unauthorized payments and requested evidence, including emails, call logs, and screenshots. David agreed to provide this evidence and to report the incidents to Action Fraud. The advisor recommended that David secure his devices by disconnecting them from the internet, uninstalling any suspicious software, and consulting his IT support team.

For future protection, the advisor suggested enabling two-factor authentication, updating passwords across accounts, and using a password manager. They provided guidance on recognizing scams, emphasizing that legitimate representatives would never request sensitive information or use high-pressure tactics. David was also advised to consider credit monitoring services to detect unusual activity.

The advisor summarized the actions taken, provided detailed next steps, and assured David of ongoing support. David expressed gratitude for the assistance and committed to following the recommendations to secure his accounts and prevent future incidents.
