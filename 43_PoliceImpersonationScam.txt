
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Sarah. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Amanda Turner.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Turner. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 17th June 1985, and my postcode is CR4 6BP.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I got a call from someone claiming to be a police officer. They said my account was at risk and convinced me to transfer my money to a “safe account.” Now I can’t access my account, and I think they’ve taken everything.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Turner. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by explaining how the call started?

Customer: They said they were a detective from the fraud squad and that there was suspicious activity on my account. They claimed someone was trying to transfer money out of it and that I needed to act immediately to protect my funds.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any specific details to make their claim seem legitimate, such as mentioning transactions or using your personal information?

Customer: Yes, they mentioned a £5,000 transfer to an account I didn’t recognize. They also knew my name, address, and even part of my account number, so I thought they were genuine.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use stolen personal data to gain trust. What did they ask you to do next?

Customer: They told me to transfer my money to a secure “police account” while they investigated. They even said they’d send me a reference number for the case.

Advisor: I see. How much did you transfer, and how did you complete the payment?

Customer: In total, I transferred £22,000 in two separate transactions through my online banking.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any follow-up information, such as a case number or contact details?

Customer: Yes, they gave me a case reference and a direct number to call them back. But when I tried calling, it didn’t connect.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like this was a police impersonation scam. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Turner. I’ve located the transactions, and they were sent to accounts flagged in our system for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from unfamiliar devices. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t.

Advisor: It suggests that your account may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite movie?”

Customer: It’s The Shawshank Redemption.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4721.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the call you received. Did the caller use any urgency, such as warnings about account suspension or legal action?

Customer: Yes, they said my account would be frozen if I didn’t act immediately. That’s why I trusted them.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in impersonation scams. Did the caller ask for any additional information, such as your PIN or online banking login credentials?

Customer: No, they didn’t ask for my PIN, but they did ask me to verify my login details during the call.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely they used that information to access your account. Did you receive any follow-up messages or emails after the call?

Customer: Yes, I got an email confirming the transactions, but I assumed it was part of their process.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s focus on the login attempts I mentioned earlier. Have you noticed any changes to your account settings, such as new payees being added?

Customer: No, I didn’t notice anything until I couldn’t log in this morning.

Advisor: Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and finalize the security measures. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Turner. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, blocked suspicious accounts, and reset your online banking credentials. I’ll also include the details of the flagged devices in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen identities can be used for further crimes. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Turner. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
