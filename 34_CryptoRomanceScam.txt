Customer: Yes, it’s Rachel Evans.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Evans. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 6th March 1988, and my postcode is NG9 1FE.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to invest in a cryptocurrency platform. At first, everything seemed fine, but now I can’t withdraw my funds, and I’ve noticed other transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Evans. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by telling me how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app about three months ago. He said he was a financial advisor specializing in cryptocurrency and that he wanted to help me grow my savings. We started chatting every day, and he seemed so knowledgeable and trustworthy.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunities did he present to you, and how did the process begin?

Customer: He said he knew about a trading platform that offered guaranteed high returns because of an algorithm they were using. He guided me through setting up an account on the platform and asked me to make an initial deposit.

Advisor: I see. How much did you initially deposit, and how were the payments made?

Customer: My first deposit was £500, which I paid using my debit card. He showed me how my account balance grew within days, so I felt confident to invest more.

Advisor: Understood. How much have you invested in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: I ended up investing about £30,000 over two months. At first, I used my debit card, but later he convinced me to transfer money directly to a bank account and, eventually, to buy cryptocurrency and send it to a wallet address he provided.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or evidence to support his claims, such as account statements or screenshots of your supposed profits?

Customer: Yes, he sent screenshots of my growing account balance and emailed me monthly statements. It all looked very professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start suspecting something might be wrong?

Customer: About a week ago, when I tried to withdraw my profits. The platform said I needed to pay a “release fee” of £5,000 to unlock my funds. That seemed odd, but he assured me it was standard. When I refused to pay, he became defensive and stopped replying to my messages.

Advisor: Did you pay the release fee?

Customer: No, I didn’t. But now I can’t log in to the platform, and I’ve noticed transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like this individual not only scammed you through the fake investment but may have also accessed your account. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate the activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Evans. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. There’s a £2,000 transfer to an unknown account, £1,800 in online purchases, and a £3,500 withdrawal from a cryptocurrency exchange. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Bella.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 3948.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s start with the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or notifications about new payees being added to your account?

Customer: Yes, I got emails confirming the payees, but I didn’t recognize them. I thought they were errors at the time.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the fraudsters added these payees to facilitate the unauthorized transactions. Did the individual you were speaking with request any personal identification, such as copies of your ID or proof of address?

Customer: Yes, he asked for my driver’s license and a recent utility bill for “verification purposes.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs to commit further crimes, such as opening fake accounts or applying for loans. I’ll guide you on protecting your identity after we secure your account. Did he ever ask you to download any apps or software?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “CryptoEdge” to monitor my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. The app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s move on to securing your account further. Did you notice any failed login attempts or changes to your account settings before this?

Customer: No, everything seemed fine until this morning when I couldn’t log in.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll include these details in our case notes and block any unauthorized devices from future access. Could you hold for a moment while I finalize these actions?

Customer: Sure.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Evans. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide advice on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so foolish for trusting him.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Evans. Romance scams are designed to exploit emotions and trust. Moving forward, I recommend verifying the identity of anyone you meet online who requests financial help. For example, you can use reverse image searches to check if their photos are linked to other profiles. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll be more careful in the future.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on avoiding similar scams and protecting your identity in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Evans. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
