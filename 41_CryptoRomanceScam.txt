
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Olivia. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Natalie Roberts.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Roberts. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 2nd February 1993, and my postcode is E11 4QR.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to invest in cryptocurrency. At first, it looked like my investment was growing, but now I can’t withdraw my funds. I also noticed transactions from my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Roberts. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by explaining how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app about four months ago. He said he was a successful cryptocurrency trader and could help me make money. He seemed so genuine and knowledgeable.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunity did he introduce you to, and how did you start?

Customer: He told me about an exclusive trading platform that only high-net-worth individuals used. He said he could get me access and guided me through setting up an account. I made an initial deposit to start trading.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial deposit, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: My first deposit was £1,000, which I paid using my debit card. He showed me how my account balance grew within days, so I invested more.

Advisor: Understood. How much did you invest in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over three months, I invested about £35,000. At first, I used my debit card, but later he convinced me to transfer money to a bank account and to purchase cryptocurrency directly and send it to a wallet address he provided.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation, such as account statements or transaction receipts, to show your balance?

Customer: Yes, he sent me monthly statements and even screenshots of my account showing profits. Everything looked professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start to suspect something was wrong?

Customer: About a week ago. I tried to withdraw some money, and the platform said I needed to pay a £5,000 “tax clearance fee” first. I refused, and when I asked him about it, he stopped replying. Now I can’t log in to the platform.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions on your bank account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw a £3,000 transfer and a £1,500 purchase from an online retailer. I didn’t authorize either of them.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Roberts. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There are also two additional transfers totaling £5,000 to cryptocurrency platforms. Do you recognize these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What was the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Bella.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4832.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the individual you were speaking with. Did he request any personal identification, such as a passport or utility bill?

Customer: Yes, he said he needed my ID to verify my trading account, so I sent him a copy of my passport.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did he ask you to download any apps or software as part of the process?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “CryptoSecure” to monitor my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let’s talk about the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, I got an email last week saying my account had been locked due to unusual activity. It asked me to log in to unlock it.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the email was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Roberts. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from a foreign IP address. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance to help you avoid scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so foolish for trusting him.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Roberts. These scams are designed to appear legitimate and build trust. Moving forward, I recommend verifying investment platforms by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying legitimate platforms?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, I think that’s a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Roberts. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
