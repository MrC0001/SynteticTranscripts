
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Martin. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Olivia Harris.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Harris. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 24th January 1995, and my postcode is S10 2TP.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency mining program online. They promised high returns, but now I can’t access my account with them, and I’ve noticed suspicious transactions on my bank account.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Harris. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you found this program and what happened?

Customer: I saw an ad on social media about making passive income through crypto mining. It looked professional, and the testimonials seemed real. I signed up and transferred money to their “platform wallet” for investments.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was your initial investment, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: My first transfer was £1,000 directly from my bank account. After that, they said I could increase my returns by investing more. Over the past two months, I’ve sent around £15,000 in total.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation or updates about your investment?

Customer: Yes, I could log into their platform, and it showed my “earnings.” They even sent monthly statements with increasing profits.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: A few days ago. I tried to withdraw my funds, and they said I needed to pay a “withdrawal fee” of £2,500. I refused, and now my account on their platform is locked. Then, yesterday, I noticed several transactions from my bank account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Harris. I’ve located several unauthorized transactions on your account. These include a £5,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency platform, £3,500 to another flagged account, and smaller purchases totaling £1,200. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Spain.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 6128.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk more about the crypto mining program. Did they ask for any personal information or access to your bank account?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my ID to verify my account, so I sent them a copy of my passport. They also asked for my bank details to “automate payouts.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs to access accounts or open new ones. Did you notice any suspicious logins or changes to your online banking after providing these details?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a new device logging into my account. I didn’t recognize it, but I assumed it was related to the crypto platform.

Advisor: Understood. Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for additional suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Harris. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. I’ve also flagged multiple new payees and removed them. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms or shared them elsewhere?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for a couple of shopping sites.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or reused credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend contacting the cryptocurrency platforms where your funds were transferred. They may be able to assist with tracking or freezing the transactions. Would you like guidance on how to proceed?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID has likely been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, initiated recovery processes for your funds, and provided guidance on improving your account security and contacting cryptocurrency platforms. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Harris. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
