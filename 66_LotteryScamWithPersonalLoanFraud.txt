Customer: Yes, it’s Hannah Wilson.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Wilson. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 11th November 1990, and my postcode is CF10 4AG.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got an email saying I’d won a lottery, but they needed me to pay some fees before I could claim the prize. I paid, but then they asked for more. Now, I’ve noticed a personal loan was taken out in my name, and my account has some transactions I didn’t make.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Wilson. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you first received the lottery notification?

Customer: The email said I’d won £500,000 in an international lottery and provided a claim number. They said I needed to pay legal and processing fees upfront to release the funds.

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you pay initially, and how was the payment made?

Customer: The first payment was £1,500, which I transferred directly to the account they provided. After that, they said there were more fees for taxes and security clearances, so I ended up sending about £7,000.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation or evidence of your winnings?

Customer: Yes, they sent me a certificate of winnings and a letter on what looked like official lottery stationery. It seemed genuine at the time.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you realize something was wrong?

Customer: After I refused to send more money, they stopped responding. Then, this morning, I saw a loan for £10,000 had been taken out in my name, and there were transactions I didn’t authorize on my account.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Wilson. I’ve identified the payments you mentioned, along with a £4,000 transfer to a flagged account, £2,500 to a cryptocurrency platform, and several smaller transactions. I can also see the loan application details. Do you recognize any of these activities?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Bella.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4936.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the loan further. Did you receive any communication or documentation regarding the loan?

Customer: Yes, I got an email confirming the loan approval and repayment schedule. I didn’t apply for it, so I was confused.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the fraudsters request any personal identification, such as your passport or utility bill?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my ID for the “prize claim,” so I sent them a copy of my passport and a utility bill.

Advisor: Understood. It’s likely the fraudsters used your details to apply for the loan. Did you notice any other unusual activity or receive further communication from them?

Customer: No, but I did get a text about a new device logging into my account.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for additional suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Wilson. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. I’ve also flagged and frozen the fraudulent loan. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for some online shopping accounts.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or reused credentials. I recommend updating your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions on securing your account and linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, initiated recovery processes for your funds, and frozen the fraudulent loan. I’ve also provided guidance on securing your account and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Wilson. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
