Customer: Yes, it’s James Carter.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Carter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 7th May 1978, and my postcode is W1B 2AG.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I work for a small company, and I received an email from our CEO instructing me to make an urgent payment to a new supplier. I processed it, but it turns out the email was fake, and now our company account is showing additional unauthorized transfers.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Carter. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the email and what it said?

Customer: The email came in yesterday morning. It looked like it was from our CEO’s usual email address and referenced a new supplier we’ve been discussing. It was marked urgent and said the payment needed to be made immediately to secure a deal.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was the payment, and where was it sent?

Customer: It was £25,000, and the account details provided were for a bank in another country. I processed the payment as instructed.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any follow-up emails or requests from the sender after the initial payment?

Customer: Yes, they asked for another payment of £30,000 later in the day, but I got suspicious and called our CEO, who told me he hadn’t sent any emails.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you noticed any additional unauthorized activity on the account since then?

Customer: Yes, there are three more transactions that I didn’t authorize—one for £10,000 and two smaller ones for £3,000 each.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve identified the transactions you mentioned, along with a £7,000 transfer to a flagged account. Do you recognize any of these beyond the initial £25,000 payment?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Harris.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 4632.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the email further. Did it include any urgency or specific instructions to make the payment seem more convincing?

Customer: Yes, it said the payment needed to be completed within the hour and not to inform anyone because it was part of a confidential deal.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use urgency and confidentiality to manipulate victims. Did the email address match your CEO’s exactly, or was there a slight variation?

Customer: It looked the same at first, but when I checked later, I noticed an extra letter in the domain name.

Advisor: Understood. Did you notice any alerts about new devices or changes to your account settings after the payment?

Customer: Yes, I received a text about a new device logging in, but I thought it was related to the payment system we use.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged and removed several suspicious payees. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for our company’s email system.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your email credentials to gather information about your company. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, that would be great.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend implementing dual authorization for large transactions in your company’s payment processes to prevent similar incidents. Would you like guidance on setting that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report and your company’s accounts for unusual activity, as your details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on monitoring your credit and implementing company-wide security practices?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and fraud prevention for your business. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Carter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
