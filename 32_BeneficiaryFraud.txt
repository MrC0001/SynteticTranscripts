Customer: Yes, it’s Karen Stevens.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Stevens. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 14th October 1982, and my postcode is RH10 7QY.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got an email this morning saying my account is under review because I’m being investigated as the beneficiary of fraudulent funds. I have no idea what’s going on, but now I can’t access my account, and I’m panicking.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Ms. Stevens. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining what the email said?

Customer: It said that suspicious activity was detected on my account, involving money from a scam. It mentioned legal action and that my account was locked pending investigation. It gave a number to call, but when I called, the person was very evasive and asked me to verify my identity by providing sensitive details.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s possible the email and call were part of a phishing attempt. Did the sender’s email address or phone number look legitimate?

Customer: The email looked official, but the phone number seemed strange—it wasn’t a UK number.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use fear tactics to manipulate people into revealing personal information. Let me check your account to confirm its current status and investigate the activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Stevens. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see that it has been temporarily restricted due to incoming funds flagged as potentially fraudulent. There’s a £15,000 transfer into your account from an unknown source, followed by multiple outgoing transactions to different accounts. Do you recognize any of this activity?

Customer: No, absolutely not. I didn’t authorize any of those transactions.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll begin the process to secure your account and block further transactions. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Cooper.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4921.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s start with the flagged funds. Have you received any messages or calls recently from individuals claiming to send you money or asking for your account details?

Customer: Yes, a week ago someone called claiming to be from a charity I donated to last year. They said they needed my account details to process a refund for a canceled event. I gave them my details because it seemed legitimate at the time.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely that call was part of the fraud scheme. Fraudsters often use such tactics to gain access to accounts. Did they mention any specific amounts or reasons for the refund?

Customer: No, they just said it was part of a system error and wanted to confirm my details quickly.

Advisor: Understood. After providing your details, did you notice any unusual activity on your account, such as new payees being added or large transactions?

Customer: Not immediately, but a few days ago, I noticed emails about payments I didn’t recognize. I assumed they were errors until my account got locked.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. Let’s talk about the outgoing transactions. Have you been contacted by anyone asking you to forward money to specific accounts or purchase gift cards?

Customer: No, I haven’t spoken to anyone about transferring money.

Advisor: That’s good to know. Based on what you’ve described, it appears the fraudsters may have used your account as a conduit to launder funds. I’ll document this and escalate the case to our investigations team.

Advisor: I’ve secured your account, blocked all flagged transactions, and reset your credentials. While our investigations team works on recovering any lost funds, I’d like to provide some guidance to prevent this from happening again. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so shaken by all of this.

Advisor: I completely understand, Ms. Stevens. Fraud schemes like this are designed to manipulate and confuse. Moving forward, always verify the identity of anyone asking for your account details, even if they claim to be from a trusted organization. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll be more careful.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as fraudsters may attempt identity theft using the information they’ve obtained. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Finally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve secured your account, blocked flagged transactions, and reset your credentials. I’ve also initiated a recovery process for any unauthorized transfers and provided guidance on improving account security and avoiding fraud in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Stevens. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
