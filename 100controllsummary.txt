Jonathan Blake contacted [Bank Name]’s Fraud Department after realizing he had been scammed by someone posing as a representative from his internet provider. The caller claimed his computer was compromised and required remote access to fix the issue. They convinced him to install software (TeamViewer) and share his online banking details and one-time passcodes, resulting in two unauthorized payments totaling £2,500 to fraudulent accounts.

The advisor identified the flagged transactions and detected multiple unauthorized login attempts to Mr. Blake’s online banking from unfamiliar IP addresses. They immediately reset his banking credentials to secure his account and initiated a dispute process to recover the funds. Mr. Blake agreed to provide evidence, including call logs and screenshots of the software installation, to support the investigation. The advisor also recommended he report the scam to Action Fraud and provided the necessary contact details.

To further secure his information, the advisor suggested disconnecting his computer from the internet, uninstalling the fraudulent software, and consulting an IT professional to check for malicious programs. They emphasized the importance of enabling two-factor authentication, updating all passwords, and using a password manager to strengthen online security.

The advisor educated Mr. Blake on recognizing tech support scams, including high-pressure tactics and unsolicited requests for payment or access, and promised to send a follow-up email with additional resources. Mr. Blake expressed gratitude for the support and committed to following the recommended steps to secure his accounts and devices while remaining vigilant against future scams.
