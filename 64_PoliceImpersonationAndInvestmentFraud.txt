Customer: Yes, it’s Sarah Cooper.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Cooper. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 19th October 1992, and my postcode is SE14 3JT.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got a call from someone claiming to be from the police, saying my account was at risk of being used in criminal activity. They convinced me to transfer my savings to a “safe account.” I did it, but now I can’t reach them, and I’m worried it was a scam.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Cooper. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the caller identified themselves and what they said?

Customer: The caller said they were Detective Inspector Mark Lewis from the Metropolitan Police. He gave a badge number and said they were investigating a large criminal network that had access to my account. It all sounded very serious.

Advisor: Thank you. What instructions did they give you, and how did they convince you to act?

Customer: They said my account was being monitored and that the safest option was to move my money into a “police-controlled account.” They guided me step by step to make the transfers and assured me it was temporary.

Advisor: Understood. How much did you transfer, and was it in one transaction or multiple?

Customer: In total, I sent about £42,000 over three transactions. The first two were direct transfers to a new payee they gave me, and the third was through a cryptocurrency platform they said was more secure.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any documentation or credentials to support their claims?

Customer: Yes, they emailed me a document with the police logo and case details. It looked very official.

Advisor: Understood. Did they ask for any additional information, such as your online banking credentials or security codes?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my login details and a one-time passcode to “authenticate” the transactions.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the fraudsters used multiple methods to access and compromise your account. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Cooper. I’ve located the transactions you mentioned, and I can see additional unauthorized activity. These include a £6,000 payment to a flagged account and £3,000 in smaller purchases. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite movie?”

Customer: It’s Inception.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4291.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the phone call further. Did the caller use any threats or urgency to pressure you into making the transfers?

Customer: Yes, they said if I didn’t act immediately, my account would be frozen, and I could face legal action for being linked to criminal activity.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use fear tactics to manipulate their victims. Did they mention anything about how the funds would be recovered?

Customer: Yes, they said the funds would be returned to me once the investigation was complete, but I needed to follow their instructions carefully to avoid compromising the case.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any follow-up communication from them after the transfers?

Customer: Yes, they called the next day to confirm I’d completed everything correctly and said they’d be in touch soon. After that, I couldn’t reach them.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for additional suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Cooper. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from a foreign IP address. I’ve also flagged additional suspicious payees and removed them. Have you used your banking credentials on any other platforms or shared them with anyone recently?

Customer: No, but I reused my banking password for an old email account.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your email account to gather information. I recommend updating your email password immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Do you need help with that?

Customer: Yes, that would be great.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your email. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Cooper. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
