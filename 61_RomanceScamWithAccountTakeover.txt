Customer: Yes, it’s Charlotte Green.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Green. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 20th June 1985, and my postcode is NG3 6AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to send money to help them with “investment issues.” Now, they’ve disappeared, and I’ve noticed emails about transactions I didn’t make. I can’t even log in to my account anymore.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Green. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you met this person and what happened?

Customer: I met them on a dating app about six months ago. They said they were an entrepreneur working abroad and needed help accessing funds for a big deal. At first, it seemed innocent—they just needed a small loan, which they promised to pay back.

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you send initially, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: I sent £500 as a bank transfer. Later, they started asking for more, saying their accounts were frozen, and they needed help covering legal fees and taxes.

Advisor: Understood. How much have you sent in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over six months, I sent about £25,000. At first, I transferred the money directly from my account, but later, they had me buy cryptocurrency and send it to their wallet.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any receipts or documents to support their claims?

Customer: Yes, they sent fake legal documents and screenshots of “pending funds” to make it seem real.

Advisor: I see. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: A few days ago. They asked for another £10,000, and I refused. That’s when they stopped replying. Then, yesterday, I noticed strange emails about payments I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for any unauthorized transactions and suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Green. I’ve identified several unauthorized transactions on your account, including a £5,000 transfer to a flagged cryptocurrency exchange, £3,000 to another unknown account, and several smaller purchases. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Jackson.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 3748.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk more about the emails you received. Did they mention anything specific, such as new payees or requests to verify transactions?

Customer: Yes, there was an email about a new payee being added, and another asking me to verify a payment. I thought it was from your bank, so I clicked the link.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the link direct you to a site resembling our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly like your website. I entered my login details and a one-time passcode.

Advisor: Understood. It sounds like the fraudsters used phishing to access your account. Did you notice any additional notifications or activity after this?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a login from a new device, but I assumed it was a mistake.

Advisor: Let me check for additional suspicious activity and review the devices linked to your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Green. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. Have you shared your credentials with any third-party services or used them on other websites?

Customer: No, but I did use the same password for a shopping account that was hacked recently.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters used the stolen credentials to access your account. I recommend uninstalling any apps linked to the fraud and running a full security scan on your devices. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend contacting the cryptocurrency platforms where your funds were sent. They may be able to assist with tracking or freezing the transactions. Would you like guidance on how to proceed with them?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed steps in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security, contacting cryptocurrency platforms, and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Green. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
