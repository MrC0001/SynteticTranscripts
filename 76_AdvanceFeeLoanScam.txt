Customer: Yes, it’s Laura Mitchell.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 20th February 1990, and my postcode is N1 5AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I applied for a loan online, and they said I needed to pay some fees upfront before it could be processed. I made the payments, but now I’ve noticed more money leaving my account, and I think I’ve been scammed.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Mitchell. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you found the loan offer and what happened?

Customer: I saw an ad online for loans with low interest rates, even for people with bad credit. I contacted them, and they said I was approved for £10,000, but I needed to pay a £300 processing fee first.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any official documents or contracts to make their offer seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they emailed me a loan agreement with their company name and address. It all looked real, so I transferred the money they asked for.

Advisor: Understood. After making the first payment, did they request any additional fees?

Customer: Yes, they said there were insurance fees and legal charges, so I ended up paying about £1,200 in total. They promised the loan would be released once everything was cleared, but then they stopped responding.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you notice unauthorized transactions on your account?

Customer: A couple of days after the last payment. I saw a £2,000 transfer and some smaller payments to accounts I don’t recognize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve identified the payments you mentioned, along with a £3,000 transfer to a flagged account and several smaller purchases totaling £900. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite book?”

Customer: It’s Pride and Prejudice.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 8743.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the loan process further. Did the company ask for any additional personal information, such as your ID or bank account details?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my passport and my bank details to “verify” the loan.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs to commit further crimes. Did they send any follow-up emails or make other requests after you paid the fees?

Customer: Yes, they sent a final email saying the loan was being processed and would arrive within 24 hours. After that, I couldn’t reach them.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged and removed several suspicious payees. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for a couple of online shopping accounts.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Mitchell. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
