
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Michael. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Catherine Porter.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Porter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 22nd March 1980, and my postcode is W1T 3AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I manage finances for my company, and we recently paid an invoice to one of our suppliers. The supplier has since told us they never sent that invoice, and now I can’t log into my business banking. I’m also seeing alerts from my personal account about transactions I didn’t make.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Porter. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the invoice was sent to you?

Customer: It came through email, just like all previous invoices from that supplier. It had their logo, the right payment terms, and even referenced a recent order we placed.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your supplier’s usual contact, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked correct at first, but I later noticed the domain name had one extra letter. It was something like [suppliername.co.uk] but with an extra “s.”

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often create lookalike email addresses to impersonate legitimate senders. Did the invoice include any mention of changes to the supplier’s usual payment details?

Customer: Yes, it said their account was under audit and provided a new bank account for this payment.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was the payment, and how was it made?

Customer: It was £125,000, transferred directly through our business banking account.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review the payment details and check for any other suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Porter. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to both your business and personal banking accounts from unfamiliar devices. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t. What does that mean?

Advisor: It suggests that your accounts may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure both accounts and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your business security question: “What is your company’s founding year?”

Customer: It’s 2010.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 8274.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll secure your business account first, and then we’ll move on to your personal account. While I do this, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the email you received. Did it include any urgency, such as warnings about penalties for late payment?

Customer: Yes, it said payment was overdue and that there would be a late fee if it wasn’t processed within 48 hours.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in invoice fraud to bypass verification processes. Did you attempt to verify the payment details with your supplier before transferring the funds?

Customer: No, I didn’t. The email seemed so legitimate, and we were busy with other orders.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s talk about your personal account. You mentioned receiving alerts about unauthorized transactions. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, there’s a £2,500 transfer and several smaller payments for online purchases. I didn’t authorize any of them.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you receive any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your personal banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, about a week ago, I got an email saying my personal account was locked due to unusual activity. It asked me to log in to resolve it.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the email was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information. Let me review your personal account for additional suspicious activity and finalize the security changes to both accounts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Porter. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions on both your business and personal accounts, initiated recovery requests, and blocked suspicious devices from accessing your accounts. I also noticed new payees added to your personal account. Did you authorize these?

Customer: No, I didn’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve removed those payees and included them in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on securing your accounts further and minimizing any future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for both your business and personal banking accounts to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your company’s payment authorization process. For example, implementing dual authorization for high-value transactions can help prevent similar incidents. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll discuss this with my team.

Advisor: Great. I also recommend conducting regular cybersecurity training for your staff to help them recognize phishing attempts and suspicious activity. Would you like resources on that?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen identities can be used for further fraud. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your credentials for both accounts, and initiated recovery processes for the funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security measures and protecting your personal information in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Porter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
