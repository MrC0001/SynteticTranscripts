Customer: Yes, it’s David Morgan.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Morgan. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 16th September 1980, and my postcode is W1T 4BG.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my company’s been scammed. I received an urgent email from someone claiming to be our CEO, asking me to transfer money for a business deal. I made the transfer, but when I mentioned it to the CEO today, he had no idea what I was talking about.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Morgan. Let me assure you, you’ve taken the right step by contacting us. Let’s investigate this together. Could you start by telling me about the email you received?

Customer: The email looked like it came from our CEO. It used his name and email signature. It said the payment was for an urgent business acquisition and needed to be kept confidential.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any specific details, such as instructions for the payment or justifications for the urgency?

Customer: Yes, it said the deal was time-sensitive and that any delays could jeopardize the opportunity. It included bank account details for the transfer and asked me not to discuss it with anyone else.

Advisor: Understood. How much was the payment, and how did you process it?

Customer: It was £80,000, and I processed it through our business banking account yesterday afternoon.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email seem consistent with the CEO’s usual communication style, or did anything about it seem off?

Customer: It was a bit formal compared to his usual emails, but it seemed plausible given the context.

Advisor: I see. Did the email come from the CEO’s exact email address, or could it have been slightly altered?

Customer: It looked exactly the same.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use spoofing techniques to replicate legitimate email addresses. Let me check the payment details and recipient account. Could you hold for a moment while I review your recent transactions?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Morgan. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged in our system for fraudulent activity. I’ll initiate a recall request immediately. Before proceeding, I need to gather more details for our investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you had any direct communication with your CEO outside of this email, such as phone calls or messages, that might clarify whether he sent this request?

Customer: No, I didn’t. The email specifically asked me not to discuss it with anyone to avoid jeopardizing the deal.

Advisor: I see. Fraudsters often use confidentiality to isolate victims and prevent verification. Did the email include any supporting documents, such as contracts or agreements?

Customer: No, just the payment instructions.

Advisor: Understood. Could you confirm whether your company uses two-factor authentication or other security measures for email accounts?

Customer: I think we use some basic filters, but I’m not sure about two-factor authentication.

Advisor: I recommend checking with your IT team. Email compromise is a common entry point for scams like this. Have you noticed any other unusual activity, such as unexpected logins or strange emails from your suppliers or other employees?

Customer: Not that I’m aware of, but I’ll have our IT team investigate.

Advisor: That’s a good idea. Let’s focus on securing your account and minimizing further risks. I’ll block any future transactions to the flagged account, reset your company’s online banking credentials, and enable enhanced fraud monitoring. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ve completed those actions. While I continue the investigation, I’d like to explain how CEO impersonation scams typically work and provide guidance to prevent them in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Great. CEO impersonation scams often involve fraudsters spoofing an executive’s email address to request urgent payments. They typically target finance teams and create a sense of urgency to bypass normal verification procedures. To prevent this, I recommend implementing a dual-authorization system for high-value transactions and requiring verbal confirmation for payment requests. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll discuss this with our team.

Advisor: That’s excellent. Additionally, I recommend implementing two-factor authentication for all email accounts and conducting regular phishing awareness training for employees. Would you like me to send you a guide on strengthening your company’s security?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized payment, initiated a recall request, and secured your account. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security and preventing future scams. Our investigations team will keep you updated on the progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Morgan. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
