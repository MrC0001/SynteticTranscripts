Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Robert. Can I take your full name to start with, please?
Customer: Yes, it’s Emma Hall.
Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Hall. Can you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?
Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 14th August 1990, and my postcode is M21 3JW.
Advisor: Great, thanks for confirming. Let me just access your account. Could you tell me a bit about why you’re calling today?
Customer: I just tried to log into my online banking, but it said my password had been changed. I didn’t change it, and now I can’t get in.
Advisor: I understand, Ms. Hall. That does sound concerning. Let’s investigate this together. When was the last time you successfully logged into your online banking?
Customer: I logged in last night around 10 p.m. Everything was fine then.
Advisor: Thank you. And when you tried to log in today, did you receive any notifications or emails about the password change?
Customer: Yes, I got an email this morning saying my password had been updated. That’s what worried me because I didn’t do it.
Advisor: Understood. Just to clarify, did the email appear to be from us, or did it look suspicious in any way?
Customer: It looked like it came from the bank. The logo and everything seemed legitimate.
Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll take a closer look at the activity on your account. This may take a few minutes. Would you mind holding?
Customer: That’s fine.
Advisor: Thank you. Please bear with me.

Advisor: Thanks for waiting, Ms. Hall. I can see that your account was accessed this morning at 7:15 a.m. from an unfamiliar IP address. The password was updated shortly after that. Does this sound like something you did?
Customer: No, definitely not. I was asleep at that time.
Advisor: Understood. This suggests that someone unauthorized may have gained access to your account. I’ll take immediate steps to secure it. Just to confirm, have you received any unusual emails, texts, or phone calls recently asking for your personal or account information?
Customer: I got a text last week saying there was suspicious activity on my account and to click a link to verify my details. I clicked the link and entered my login information. Do you think that’s related?
Advisor: It’s highly likely. It sounds like a phishing attempt, which scammers use to steal sensitive information. Thank you for mentioning that. Do you remember what the text said or the link you clicked on?
Customer: It said something like, “Urgent: Your account is at risk. Verify your details now to avoid suspension.” I didn’t think much of it at the time.
Advisor: Thank you. That information is very helpful. I’ll report the phishing attempt to our internal team. For now, let’s focus on securing your account. I’ll block all access to your online banking while we investigate further. Does that sound okay?
Customer: Yes, please do that.
Advisor: I’ll action that now. While I’m doing that, I’ll also generate a report on recent activity on your account. This will help us identify any unauthorized transactions. Could you hold for another moment?
Customer: Sure.
Advisor: Thank you.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Hall. I’ve blocked access to your online banking, so no further activity can occur. I’ve also reviewed your transaction history. I can see that there was a transfer of £1,200 made this morning to an account ending in 9834. Do you recognize this transaction?
Customer: No, I didn’t make that transfer.
Advisor: Understood. I’ll flag this as unauthorized and start the process to recover the funds. Just to confirm, do you have any recurring payments or direct debits set up on your account?
Customer: Yes, I have a few. My rent, utilities, and a gym membership.
Advisor: Thank you. I’ll ensure those payments are not disrupted while we secure your account. Have you noticed any unusual activity on your debit card, such as unfamiliar purchases or cash withdrawals?
Customer: No, not that I’ve seen.
Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let’s take additional precautions to prevent further issues. I’ll order you a new debit card and update your online banking credentials. Before I do that, I’ll need to verify some additional security details. Could you confirm the answer to your security question? It’s “What is your mother’s maiden name?”
Customer: It’s Taylor.
Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?
Customer: It’s 2457.
Advisor: Perfect. I’ll proceed with issuing a new debit card and resetting your online banking credentials. While I’m doing that, let me explain the next steps. Our fraud team will investigate the unauthorized transfer and work to recover the funds. This process can take up to 10 working days, but we’ll keep you updated. Does that make sense?
Customer: Yes, that’s fine. I just want my account to be safe.
Advisor: Absolutely. Your safety is our priority. I’ve also added enhanced monitoring to your account. This means any unusual activity will trigger immediate alerts. Additionally, I recommend changing the passwords on any other accounts where you may have used the same login details. Would you like me to send you guidance on creating secure passwords?
Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.
Advisor: I’ll arrange that. One more thing—have you reported the phishing text you received to Action Fraud?
Customer: No, I haven’t. Should I?
Advisor: Yes, I recommend doing so. Action Fraud is the UK’s national fraud reporting centre, and they can provide additional support. I can give you their contact details if you’d like.
Customer: Yes, please.
Advisor: Their phone number is 0300 123 2040, and you can also report online at actionfraud.police.uk. They’ll provide you with a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.
Customer: Thank you. I’ll do that.
Advisor: You’re welcome. Before we finish, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Customer: No, I think that’s everything.
Advisor: Great. To summarize, I’ve blocked access to your online banking, flagged the unauthorized transfer for investigation, issued a new debit card, and reset your online credentials. I’ve also added enhanced monitoring to your account and reported the phishing attempt. Our fraud team will keep you updated on the progress. If you need further assistance, don’t hesitate to call us again. Thank you for contacting us, Ms. Hall. Take care.
Customer: Thank you, Robert. I appreciate your help.
Advisor: You’re welcome. Have a good day.
