
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Mark. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Sarah Davis.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Davis. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 14th October 1982, and my postcode is BD1 2AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I was buying a used car online, and the seller asked for a deposit. I sent the money, but now they’ve disappeared, and I’ve noticed other payments leaving my account that I didn’t make.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Davis. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you found the car and what happened?

Customer: I saw the ad on a classifieds website. The seller claimed they needed to sell the car quickly because they were moving abroad. They asked for a £3,000 deposit to secure the deal.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any proof of ownership or other documents to make their offer seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they sent a scanned copy of the car’s registration and some photos. It all looked real, so I transferred the deposit to their account.

Advisor: Understood. After making the payment, did they provide any further communication or requests?

Customer: No, they stopped responding completely. That’s when I started getting worried.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you noticed any other unusual activity on your account, such as new payees or unexpected payments?

Customer: Yes, there are several payments to accounts I don’t recognize, including one for £4,000.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Davis. I’ve identified the £3,000 payment you mentioned, as well as a £4,000 transfer to a flagged account and smaller payments totaling £1,800. Do you recognize any of these additional transactions?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite restaurant?”

Customer: It’s Bella Italia.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 5462.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the seller further. Did they use any urgency to convince you to make the payment quickly?

Customer: Yes, they said there was another buyer interested and that the car would be sold if I didn’t transfer the deposit immediately.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address or phone number they used seem suspicious or unusual?

Customer: It was a Gmail address, and the phone number was a foreign one, but they said it was because they were already abroad.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any notifications from the bank about new devices or changes to your account after making the payment?

Customer: Yes, I got a text saying a new device logged into my account, but I assumed it was a mistake.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Davis. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged several suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for my email and another online service.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Davis. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
