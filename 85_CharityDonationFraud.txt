Customer: Yes, it’s Rachel Thompson.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Thompson. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 10th April 1975, and my postcode is EH1 2AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I received a phone call from someone claiming to be from a charity I’ve supported in the past. They said they were raising funds for disaster relief, so I donated. But now I’ve noticed several payments I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Thompson. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the call went and what they asked you to do?

Customer: They mentioned my past donations to the charity and said they were collecting emergency funds for a recent natural disaster. They asked for my card details to process a one-time donation of £200.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any verification, such as your donation history, or create urgency during the call?

Customer: Yes, they mentioned a donation I made last year and said the funds were urgently needed to provide medical supplies. That’s why I didn’t question it.

Advisor: Understood. Have you noticed any other unauthorized transactions or unusual activity on your account?

Customer: Yes, there are multiple payments to accounts I don’t recognize, including one for £3,000.

Advisor: Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Thompson. I’ve identified the £200 donation, as well as a £3,000 transfer and smaller payments totaling £1,500. Do you recognize any of these additional transactions?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Italy.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 7842.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the charity call further. Did the caller’s phone number appear legitimate, or was it withheld?

Customer: It showed as a local number, which is why I trusted it.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they send you any follow-up communication, such as a receipt or confirmation email?

Customer: No, they said they’d send a receipt by post, but I haven’t received anything.

Advisor: Understood. Did you notice any notifications from the bank about new devices or changes to your account settings after the donation?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a new device logging in, but I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Thompson. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged several suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for my email and a shopping account.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Thompson. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
