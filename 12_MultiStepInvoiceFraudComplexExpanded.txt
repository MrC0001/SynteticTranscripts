Customer: Yes, it’s Jonathan Miller.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Miller. Can you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 15th July 1982, and the postcode is LS7 3AF.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account now. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my business has been targeted by a scam. We received an email from one of our suppliers asking for payment to a new account. It seemed legitimate, so I made the transfer, but now the supplier says they never sent that email or changed their account details.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Miller. Let me assure you that you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s take this step by step to understand what happened. Could you start by telling me about the email you received? What did it say, and did it include any supporting documents?

Customer: The email came from what looked like our supplier’s usual email address. They said they’d updated their banking details and attached an invoice for payment. The invoice matched our records for a pending order, so I didn’t think twice.

Advisor: I see. Could you confirm how much the payment was for and how you processed it?

Customer: It was for £48,000, and I processed it through our company’s online banking system.

Advisor: Understood. Did the email contain any unusual language, or did it seem consistent with how your supplier usually communicates?

Customer: It seemed consistent. The logo, signature, and wording all looked professional, just like their usual emails.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Did you try to verify the account change with the supplier before making the payment?

Customer: No, I didn’t. The email said the change was due to “internal restructuring” and that payments to the old account would be returned. It sounded plausible at the time.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Fraudsters often use convincing explanations to bypass standard verification procedures. Could you confirm whether your company uses two-factor authentication or any other email security measures?

Customer: I’m not sure. I’ll need to check with our IT team.

Advisor: That’s okay. I recommend verifying that as soon as possible, as compromised email accounts are often the entry point for these scams. Could you hold for a moment while I locate the payment in our system and check the recipient account details?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Miller. I’ve located the payment in question, and it was sent to an account ending in 3728. This account is flagged in our system for suspected fraudulent activity. I’ll initiate a recall request to recover the funds. Before proceeding further, could you confirm whether you’ve noticed any other unusual emails, unauthorized logins, or suspicious activity in your inbox?

Customer: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ll check with our IT team, though, to be sure.

Advisor: That’s a good idea. Could you also provide details of any other payments made to this supplier recently? This will help us identify if there’s a pattern of fraudulent activity.

Customer: The last payment I made to them was two weeks ago for £12,000. That one went to their usual account, and there were no issues.

Advisor: Thank you. That helps establish a timeline. Let’s focus on securing your account and minimizing further risks. I’ll block any future transactions to the flagged account, reset your online banking credentials, and enable enhanced fraud monitoring. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ll handle that now. While I’m processing the recall request, I’d like to discuss how invoice fraud typically works and provide guidance to prevent it in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Invoice fraud often begins with email compromise or spoofing. Fraudsters monitor email exchanges to identify legitimate payment patterns. They then send spoofed emails or hack into accounts to redirect those payments to fraudulent accounts. In this case, it’s likely that your supplier’s email account was compromised or that their address was spoofed. Moving forward, I recommend verifying any account changes directly with the supplier using a trusted phone number. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll make sure we do that from now on.

Advisor: That’s excellent. Additionally, I recommend implementing email security measures, such as two-factor authentication and regular password updates, across your company’s systems. Would you like me to send you a guide on improving email security?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Could you also confirm whether your company has cyber insurance or fraud protection policies in place?

Customer: Yes, we do. I haven’t contacted them yet because I wasn’t sure if I should wait for the bank’s investigation.

Advisor: It’s a good idea to notify your insurer as soon as possible. They may require a reference number from us to process your claim. I’ll provide you with all the necessary details. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let’s summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transaction, initiated a recall request, and secured your online banking account. I’ve also provided guidance on strengthening email security and preventing future scams. Do you have any questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Do you think we’ll get the money back?

Advisor: We’ll do everything we can to recover the funds. Since the transaction was flagged quickly, there’s a good chance we can recall it. Our investigations team will keep you updated on the progress. If you have further concerns, don’t hesitate to contact us.

Customer: Thank you so much for your help. I really appreciate it.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Miller. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
