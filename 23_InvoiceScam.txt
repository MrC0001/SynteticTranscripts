Customer: Yes, it’s Peter Simmons.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Simmons. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th March 1983, and my postcode is B5 7RS.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my business has been scammed. We received an email from one of our suppliers asking for payment to a new account. It seemed legitimate, so I made the transfer, but now they’re saying they never sent that email, and the account details don’t belong to them.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Simmons. Let me assure you that you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step to get a clear picture. Could you start by telling me about the email you received?

Customer: The email came from what looked like our supplier’s usual address. It even had the same email thread we’d been using for weeks about the upcoming payment. They said they’d changed their banking details because of an audit and needed the funds urgently.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any attachments or invoices, and if so, did they match your records?

Customer: Yes, it had an invoice attached. The invoice matched the amount and description of the order we were expecting, so I didn’t think twice.

Advisor: Understood. How much was the payment, and how did you process it?

Customer: It was £45,000, and I made the transfer through our company’s online banking system yesterday afternoon.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. Did the email seem consistent with their usual communication style, or did anything about it stand out as unusual?

Customer: It was a bit more formal than usual, but I assumed it was because of the audit they mentioned. The email address looked exactly the same as the one they always use.

Advisor: I understand. Fraudsters often mimic legitimate emails to make their requests appear authentic. Did the email request any specific timeframe for the payment, such as needing it processed urgently?

Customer: Yes, they said the funds were needed within 24 hours to meet some regulatory deadline.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. Creating a sense of urgency is a common tactic used in scams to pressure people into acting quickly without verifying details. Let me check the payment details and recipient account. Could you hold for a moment while I review your recent transactions?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Simmons. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged in our system for fraudulent activity. I’ll initiate a recall request immediately. Before I proceed, I need to gather more details for our investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you had any direct communication with your supplier outside of email, such as phone calls or messages?

Customer: Not recently. I emailed them to confirm the payment, and that’s when they said they didn’t request it.

Advisor: I see. It’s possible their email account was compromised. Did you notice anything unusual about their email address, such as spelling errors, extra characters, or a different domain?

Customer: No, it looked exactly the same as their usual address.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use spoofing techniques to replicate legitimate email addresses. I’ll include this in the case notes. Let’s move on to your company’s email security. Do you use two-factor authentication or anti-phishing tools for your email accounts?

Customer: I believe we use some basic filters, but I’m not sure about two-factor authentication.

Advisor: I recommend checking with your IT team. Email compromise is a common entry point for scams like this. Have you noticed any other unusual activity, such as unexpected logins, changes to email settings, or strange emails from your suppliers?

Customer: Not that I’m aware of, but I’ll ask our IT team to investigate.

Advisor: That’s a good idea. Let’s focus on securing your account and minimizing further risks. I’ll block any future transactions to the flagged account, reset your company’s online banking credentials, and enable enhanced fraud monitoring. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ve completed those actions. While I continue the investigation, I’d like to explain how invoice scams typically work and provide some guidance to prevent them in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Great. Invoice scams often involve fraudsters compromising email accounts or spoofing email addresses to redirect legitimate payments. They monitor email threads and wait for an opportunity to send fraudulent payment requests. Moving forward, I recommend verifying any changes to payment details directly with the supplier using a trusted phone number. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll make sure to do that from now on.

Advisor: That’s excellent. Additionally, I recommend implementing two-factor authentication for your email accounts and training employees to recognize phishing attempts. Would you like me to send you a guide on strengthening email security?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized payment, initiated a recall request, and secured your account. I’ve also provided guidance on improving email security and preventing future scams. Our investigations team will keep you updated on the progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Simmons. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
