Customer: Yes, it’s Jennifer Carter.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Carter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 15th February 1984, and the postcode is LS2 8HD.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I met someone online, and we’ve been talking for months. He said he needed help with some business issues and asked me to send him money. Now I’ve noticed unauthorized transactions on my account, and he’s stopped replying.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Carter. Let me assure you, you’ve taken the right step by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by telling me how you met this person?

Customer: We met on a dating app about six months ago. He said he was a business consultant living abroad but planning to move to the UK soon. We started chatting every day, and he seemed so genuine.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. What kind of financial issues did he describe, and how did he ask for your help?

Customer: He said his company was having cash flow problems because a big client hadn’t paid on time. He asked if I could loan him some money for a few weeks, just until the payment came through.

Advisor: I see. How much money have you sent him, and how were the payments made?

Customer: Over the last two months, I’ve sent him about £12,000. The first few payments were by bank transfer, and then he asked me to send money through a cryptocurrency exchange.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or evidence to support his claims, such as contracts, invoices, or proof of his business dealings?

Customer: Yes, he sent me pictures of contracts and even screenshots of his emails with the client. Everything looked professional.

Advisor: Understood. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: A few weeks ago, he started asking for more money, saying he needed to pay taxes before he could access his funds. I asked why he couldn’t use the money I’d already sent, and he became defensive. Then, this morning, I noticed transactions on my account that I didn’t make.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like this individual may have also accessed your account directly. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any unauthorized activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Carter. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. There’s a £1,500 transfer to a new payee, £800 in online purchases, and a £2,000 withdrawal from a cryptocurrency platform. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the flagged accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to reset your credentials. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Parker.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 3742.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s start with the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your account details or provide a one-time passcode?

Customer: Yes, actually. I got a text yesterday saying there was suspicious activity on my account and asking me to confirm my identity. It included a link, which I clicked.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the fraudsters used that link to capture your account credentials. Did the website you were directed to look like the bank’s official site?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information. After entering your details, did you notice any unusual activity, such as failed login attempts or changes to your account settings?

Customer: No, everything seemed fine until this morning.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. Let’s move on to the individual you were speaking to online. Did they request any personal information from you, such as copies of your ID or utility bills?

Customer: Yes, he said he needed them to verify the transfer on his end, so I sent a picture of my driver’s license.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities to commit further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. I’ll guide you on protecting your identity after we secure your account.

Customer: Okay.

Advisor: Did he ever ask you to download any apps or software, or provide access to your devices?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “SecurePay” to monitor the transfers.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. The app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. I’ll also provide guidance on securing your devices further. Let’s focus on minimizing further risks and recovering your funds.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide advice on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for trusting him.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Carter. Romance scams are designed to exploit trust and emotions. Moving forward, I recommend verifying the identity of anyone requesting financial help online. For example, you can use reverse image searches or consult business registries if they claim to own a company. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, never share personal identification documents unless you’re absolutely sure of the recipient’s legitimacy. Monitoring your credit report for unusual activity is also a good step, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like me to send you a guide on protecting your identity?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on protecting your identity and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Carter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
