Customer: Hi, it’s Caroline Mitchell.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 4th April 1987, and my postcode is NE3 2AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I got an email saying I was due to inherit some money from a distant relative. I’ve been corresponding with them for a couple of weeks, and they asked for some fees upfront. Now I’ve transferred the money, but I can’t get hold of them anymore.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear this, Ms. Mitchell. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you came across this inheritance claim?

Customer: It started with an email. They said I was listed as a beneficiary of someone who recently passed away overseas. It looked official, with documents and everything.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any official-looking seals or references to law firms or government bodies?

Customer: Yes, there was a lawyer’s letterhead and some kind of court order attached. It all seemed legitimate.

Advisor: Understood. How much have you sent so far, and how were the payments made?

Customer: I’ve transferred about £12,000 over three payments. They said it was for legal fees, taxes, and other processing charges.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Did you notice any unusual language or urgent requests in their emails?

Customer: Yes, they said the inheritance process would be delayed or canceled if I didn’t pay quickly. That’s why I sent the money without questioning it too much.

Advisor: I understand. Let me review your account for these payments and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve identified the three payments you mentioned, totaling £12,000, as well as an additional payment attempt for £5,000 that was blocked by our system. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t. I didn’t try to make another payment.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. It’s possible that fraudsters attempted to initiate this payment using your account details. Let me investigate any suspicious activity further. Could you hold for another moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve found multiple unauthorized devices linked to your online banking, including one from an overseas IP address. This suggests your account credentials may have been compromised. Have you shared your login details or any security codes with anyone?

Customer: I did provide a security code when they said they needed to verify the transfer. I thought it was part of the process.

Advisor: Thank you for letting me know. It’s likely that’s how they gained access. I’ll reset your online banking credentials immediately to secure your account. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 5682.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll process that now. While I’m doing this, let’s also discuss further steps to protect your information and recover the funds. Would you like assistance with this?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: First, I recommend reporting this to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They can provide a reference number for your case. Additionally, I’ll initiate a dispute for the payments made to the fraudsters. While there’s no guarantee of recovery, we’ll do our best to assist.

Customer: Thank you. I’ll contact Action Fraud as soon as we’re done here.

Advisor: That’s a great step. Let’s also enable two-factor authentication for your online banking to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in a follow-up email. Additionally, I recommend changing the passwords for any other accounts where you’ve used the same credentials. Would you like guidance on creating secure passwords?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: Let’s also discuss recognizing similar scams in the future. Fraudsters often use official-looking documents to appear credible. Always verify claims through independent sources, such as government registries or legal professionals. Did they provide any contact information for verification?

Customer: Yes, they gave me a phone number, but it went straight to voicemail when I tried to call it.

Advisor: That’s a common tactic. In genuine cases, you’d typically have direct access to the solicitor or official handling the matter. I’ll include tips in the follow-up email on how to verify legal claims safely.

Customer: Thank you. I’ll make sure to be more cautious in the future.

Advisor: Before we wrap up, let me summarize the steps we’ve taken. I’ve flagged the payments to the fraudulent account, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated a dispute process. I’ve also recommended contacting Action Fraud and enabling two-factor authentication. Lastly, I’ll provide guidance on improving your account security and recognizing potential scams. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Mitchell. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have any further concerns, don’t hesitate to contact us. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
