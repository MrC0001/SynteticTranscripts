Customer: Hi, it’s David Clarke.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Clarke. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th June 1980, and my postcode is E15 4AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: It’s a bit complicated. Over the past couple of months, I’ve been involved in a couple of different situations—there was a cryptocurrency investment, then someone claiming to be from the bank called about suspicious transactions, and now I’ve noticed my account balance doesn’t add up.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear this, Mr. Clarke. Let me assure you, we’ll thoroughly investigate this. Could you start by breaking down these events for me? Let’s take them one at a time, starting with the cryptocurrency investment. Can you tell me more about how it began?

Customer: Sure. I saw an ad on social media for a crypto platform that promised high returns. I signed up, and a representative contacted me almost immediately. They seemed knowledgeable and walked me through the setup.

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you initially invest, and what method did you use to transfer the funds?

Customer: My initial investment was £5,000. I sent the money via a bank transfer to an account they provided.

Advisor: Did the representative provide any documentation or proof of their legitimacy?

Customer: Yes, they sent me a certificate that looked official, and I even had video calls with them. It all seemed above board at the time.

Advisor: Understood. When did you first suspect something was wrong?

Customer: About a month later. They said my investment had grown significantly and encouraged me to deposit more money to access a “premium account.” I sent another £10,000, but when I tried to withdraw, they said I needed to pay a “release fee” of £2,500. That’s when I started to feel uneasy.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let’s set that aside for a moment and move on to the call you received claiming to be from the bank. Could you describe what happened?

Customer: A man called, saying he was from your fraud team. He said there had been suspicious activity on my account and asked me to transfer money to a “secure account” to protect it. He sounded professional, so I believed him.

Advisor: I understand. How much did you transfer, and where did the funds go?

Customer: I transferred £20,000 in two separate payments to an account he gave me. He also asked for my online banking login details to “monitor the situation.”

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any verification of his identity, like a badge number or reference code?

Customer: Yes, he gave me a badge number and said I could verify his identity by calling the bank’s helpline, but he said to call from the same line to “speed up the process.” I think he kept the line open.

Advisor: That’s a common tactic used by fraudsters. Finally, let’s talk about the discrepancies you noticed in your account balance. Could you describe what’s missing?

Customer: When I logged in yesterday, I noticed two payments I didn’t authorize—£4,000 and £3,000. Both went to accounts I don’t recognize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Clarke. I’ve reviewed your account and identified multiple suspicious transactions totaling £44,500. These include payments to flagged accounts linked to fraud. Additionally, there are login attempts from multiple overseas IP addresses. Did you share any one-time passcodes with anyone recently?

Customer: Yes, the man who claimed to be from your team asked for the passcodes. He said it was part of verifying my account.

Advisor: Thank you. That likely allowed unauthorized access. I’ll reset your online banking credentials and block further transactions to these accounts immediately. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 9324.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll secure your account now. While I do that, let’s discuss steps to recover your funds and protect your information. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: First, I’ll initiate disputes for the unauthorized transactions. We’ll work with the receiving banks to attempt recovery. Please note that this process can take time and isn’t always guaranteed, but we’ll keep you updated.

Customer: Thank you. What do I need to do to help with this?

Advisor: It would be helpful if you could provide any evidence of your interactions with the fraudsters, such as emails, call logs, or screenshots. Could you email those to us?

Customer: Yes, I’ve kept everything. I’ll send it over today.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll email you the details for submitting the evidence after this call. Additionally, I recommend reporting the incidents to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number we can include in our investigation.

Customer: I’ll do that immediately. Thank you.

Advisor: Let’s also secure your devices and online accounts. Fraudsters may have installed malicious software or gained access to your email. Do you have an IT professional who can assist with a security check?

Customer: Yes, I’ll contact my IT support team.

Advisor: That’s a great step. In the meantime, I recommend disconnecting your devices from the internet and uninstalling any software they asked you to install. I’ll send tips on securing your devices in the follow-up email.

Customer: Thank you. I’ll make sure to do that.

Advisor: To prevent future incidents, let’s also discuss recognizing scams. Fraudsters often use urgent language and ask for sensitive information. Did any of the callers use high-pressure tactics?

Customer: Yes, they both said I needed to act immediately or risk losing my money. It was very stressful.

Advisor: That’s a common tactic. Genuine bank representatives will never pressure you to act quickly or ask for login details or passcodes. I’ll include guidance on recognizing scams in the follow-up email.

Customer: That would be helpful. I don’t want this to happen again.

Advisor: Before we finish, let’s enable two-factor authentication for your online banking and update your passwords for any accounts that may have been compromised. Would you like assistance setting this up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in the follow-up email. Lastly, consider signing up for credit monitoring services to check for unusual activity. Would you like advice on this?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken today. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions and initiated recovery requests. I’ve secured your online banking credentials, recommended reporting the incidents to Action Fraud, and provided advice on securing your devices and recognizing scams. In the follow-up email, I’ll include detailed instructions on enabling two-factor authentication, updating passwords, and setting up credit monitoring. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Clarke. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have any further concerns, don’t hesitate to contact us. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
