Customer: Yes, it’s Olivia Bennett.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Bennett. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 18th August 1994, and my postcode is E5 8QP.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to invest in cryptocurrency. I sent money to him, but now he’s vanished, and I’ve noticed some transactions from my account that I didn’t authorize. I also can’t log in to my banking app anymore.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Bennett. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app six months ago. He said he was a financial expert and could help me grow my savings. He seemed so genuine, and we talked almost every day.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunity did he introduce you to, and how did you start?

Customer: He told me about a crypto trading platform that only experts use. He guided me through setting up an account and asked me to send him money so he could “manage” the investment for me.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial investment, and how was the payment made?

Customer: My first transfer was £2,000, which I sent directly to his wallet address. He showed me screenshots of how my investment was growing, so I trusted him.

Advisor: Understood. How much have you invested in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over the last few months, I’ve sent him about £45,000. At first, I transferred the money directly, but later he had me buy cryptocurrency and send it to different wallet addresses.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or proof of the growing investment?

Customer: Yes, he sent me monthly statements showing profits and screenshots of the trading platform. Everything looked professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: About a week ago. I tried to withdraw some of my funds, and he said there were “processing fees” of £5,000. I refused to pay, and now he’s stopped responding. Then, this morning, I noticed emails about payments leaving my account that I didn’t make.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Bennett. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. These include a £3,000 payment to a flagged cryptocurrency platform, £2,500 to another flagged account, and several smaller purchases. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Italy.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4821.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the cryptocurrency platform he mentioned. Did you access it directly, or did he manage the account for you entirely?

Customer: He managed everything. I just sent the money, and he handled the investments.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he ask for any personal identification, such as a passport or a utility bill?

Customer: Yes, he said he needed my ID to verify my account, so I sent him a copy of my passport.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did he ask you to download any apps or software as part of the process?

Customer: Yes, he told me to install an app called “TradeSecure” to monitor my investment. It seemed legitimate at the time.

Advisor: Understood. It’s possible that app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Bennett. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from an overseas IP address. Have you traveled recently or shared your login credentials with anyone?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to the cryptocurrency platforms where your funds were transferred. They may be able to assist with tracking or freezing the funds. Would you like guidance on how to contact them?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed steps in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security, contacting cryptocurrency platforms, and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Bennett. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
