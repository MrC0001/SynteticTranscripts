Customer: Yes, it’s James Harris.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Harris. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 3rd September 1985, and my postcode is L3 8SD.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency platform that promised guaranteed returns, but now I can’t withdraw my money, and the website has disappeared. On top of that, I’ve noticed transactions from my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Harris. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this together. Could you start by explaining how you first came across this platform?

Customer: I saw an ad on social media claiming to be a partnership with a well-known financial expert. It said they’d discovered a loophole in cryptocurrency trading. I clicked on the link, and it took me to a professional-looking website.

Advisor: Thank you. What happened after you visited the website? Did you create an account?

Customer: Yes, I signed up and deposited an initial £500 using my debit card. Shortly after, someone called me and introduced himself as my “personal investment advisor.” He said I’d already earned £200 in profits and encouraged me to invest more.

Advisor: I see. How much did you invest in total, and how were the payments made?

Customer: Over two months, I invested about £25,000. At first, I used my card, but then they asked me to transfer money directly to a bank account, and later they had me deposit funds through a cryptocurrency wallet.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation, such as account statements or proof of your investment’s growth?

Customer: Yes, they sent weekly statements showing my balance growing. The profits seemed so real, and their platform even had a dashboard where I could see live trading activity.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: About a week ago. I tried to withdraw some of my profits, and they said I needed to pay a £5,000 “release fee.” That seemed odd, but I paid it anyway. Then they said there was another fee for “international tax clearance.” That’s when I became suspicious.

Advisor: Did you pay the second fee?

Customer: No, I refused. That’s when they stopped responding to my calls and emails. I also noticed unauthorized transactions on my account this morning.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like the fraudsters may have accessed your account directly. Let me review your recent transactions and cross-check the recipient accounts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Harris. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. There’s a £2,000 transfer to a flagged account, £1,200 in online purchases, and a £3,500 transaction to a cryptocurrency platform. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What was the name of your first school?”

Customer: It’s Riverside Primary.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 5678.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the cryptocurrency platform. Did they request any personal identification, such as copies of your ID, proof of address, or other documents?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my driver’s license for “verification.” They also asked for a recent utility bill.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts or applying for loans. I’ll guide you on protecting your identity after we secure your account. Did they ever ask you to download any apps or software?

Customer: Yes, they had me install an app called “CryptoSecure” to monitor my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or notifications about new payees or transactions being processed?

Customer: Yes, I got emails confirming the payments, but I didn’t recognize the recipients.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the fraudsters added new payees to facilitate these transactions. I’ll block these payees and secure your account further.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide advice on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Of course. Cryptocurrency scams often promise high returns with minimal risk, which is a red flag. Always verify investment platforms by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying trustworthy platforms?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on avoiding similar scams and protecting your identity in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Harris. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
