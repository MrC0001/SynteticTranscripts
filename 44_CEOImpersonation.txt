Customer: Yes, it’s James Carter.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Carter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 8th May 1979, and my postcode is SW1A 1AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my business has been scammed. I got an urgent email from someone claiming to be my CEO, asking for a payment to secure a deal. I made the transfer, but now my CEO says he never sent that email. On top of that, I’ve noticed other transactions from my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Carter. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the email?

Customer: It looked like it came from my CEO’s email address. It included his signature and referenced a legitimate project we’re working on. It asked for an urgent payment to close a deal and said I needed to act immediately.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your CEO’s usual contact, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked correct at first, but later I noticed the domain name had an extra letter.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use lookalike email addresses to impersonate senior executives. What instructions were given in the email, and how did you proceed?

Customer: It included new bank account details and said the payment needed to be made within the hour. I transferred £80,000 through our business account.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any attachments or supporting documents, such as contracts or invoices?

Customer: Yes, there was a document attached that looked like a purchase agreement for the deal.

Advisor: I see. Let me review the payment details and check for any other suspicious activity on your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from unfamiliar devices. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t. What does that mean?

Advisor: It suggests that your account may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Walker.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 8294.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the email you received. Did it include any urgency or mention of confidentiality, such as asking you not to discuss the payment with anyone?

Customer: Yes, it said the deal was time-sensitive and confidential. I was told not to share the details with anyone else in the company.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency and confidentiality is a common tactic in CEO impersonation scams. Did the email include a phone number to confirm the payment, and if so, did you call it?

Customer: Yes, it included a number, and I called it. Someone answered, claiming to be part of the CEO’s team and verified the instructions.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters used a spoofed number to appear legitimate. After completing the payment, did you receive any follow-up communications?

Customer: Yes, they sent another email thanking me for acting quickly and said they’d provide updates later. But then I didn’t hear from them again.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions you mentioned earlier. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, there’s a £15,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency exchange and two smaller payments totaling £4,000. I didn’t authorize any of them.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you receive any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying my account had been locked due to suspicious activity. It asked me to log in to verify my details.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the email was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and finalize the security measures. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and blocked suspicious accounts. I’ve also reset your online banking credentials and included details of the flagged devices in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your company’s payment authorization process. For example, implementing dual authorization for high-value payments can help prevent similar incidents. Would you like guidance on that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Carter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
