Customer: Yes, it’s Laura Bennett.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Bennett. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 5th April 1992, and my postcode is N12 8QS.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think someone’s hacked into my account. I noticed some transactions I didn’t make, and I can’t log in anymore. I also got a strange email from the bank asking me to verify my details, and I think I might’ve fallen for it.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Bennett. You’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by telling me about the email you received?

Customer: It looked like it was from the bank. It said there was suspicious activity on my account and asked me to click a link to verify my identity. I clicked it and entered my details.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the email might have been a phishing attempt. Did the website you were directed to resemble our official banking site?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same.

Advisor: Understood. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information. After you entered your details, did you notice any unusual activity on your account, such as changes to your settings or failed login attempts?

Customer: Not immediately. But this morning, I saw emails confirming payments I didn’t make, and now I can’t log in at all.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Bennett. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. There’s a £2,500 transfer to a new payee, £1,800 in online purchases, and a pending payment of £3,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Paris.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 5438.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the phishing email you received. Did the sender’s email address look legitimate, or did it have any unusual characters or domains?

Customer: It looked legitimate. It even had your bank’s logo in the header.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often spoof official email formats to appear authentic. Did the email include any urgency, such as warnings about account suspension or immediate action required?

Customer: Yes, it said my account would be frozen if I didn’t respond within 24 hours.

Advisor: I see. Creating urgency is a common tactic to pressure victims into acting quickly. Let’s discuss the transactions. Have you received any emails or notifications about new payees being added to your account?

Customer: Yes, I got emails confirming the payees, but I didn’t think much of it at the time because I assumed they were fake alerts.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often add new payees to facilitate unauthorized transfers. Let’s move on to the devices used to access your account. Have you logged in recently from any unfamiliar devices or networks?

Customer: No, I usually only use my phone or laptop at home.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll check the devices and IP addresses associated with recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Sure.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Bennett. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from overseas. Have you traveled recently or shared your account details with anyone?

Customer: No, I haven’t traveled or shared my details.

Advisor: Thank you. This confirms unauthorized access. I’ll include these details in the case notes and block those devices from further attempts. Let’s focus on recovering the funds and securing your account further.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide advice on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for falling for the email.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Bennett. Phishing scams are designed to look convincing. Moving forward, I recommend verifying the sender’s information before clicking on links in emails. If you’re unsure, contact us directly using the number on the back of your card. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance with setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. I also recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as fraudsters may attempt identity theft using the information they’ve obtained. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, blocked access to flagged devices, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding phishing scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Bennett. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
