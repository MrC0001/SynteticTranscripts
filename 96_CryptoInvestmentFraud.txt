Customer: Hi, it’s Rebecca Taylor.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Taylor. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 23rd January 1990, and my postcode is SW3 5HX.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency platform that promised big returns, but now my account is locked, and I can’t withdraw my funds. They’re asking for more money to “verify” my account.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear this, Ms. Taylor. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you came across the investment platform?

Customer: I saw an ad on social media. It looked legitimate, with testimonials and endorsements from well-known people. I clicked the link, signed up, and deposited £5,000 to start.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the platform provide any documents or credentials to verify their legitimacy?

Customer: Yes, they sent me an email with a certificate that looked official. They also assigned me a personal account manager who called me regularly to discuss my investments.

Advisor: Understood. Have they requested any additional payments since your initial deposit?

Customer: Yes, they’ve asked for another £3,000 for “account verification.” They said it’s a standard process to release my funds.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these payments and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Taylor. I’ve identified two payments totaling £8,000 to the account associated with the platform. I’ve also flagged several login attempts from overseas IP addresses. Did you share your online banking details or any security codes with the platform?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my online banking login to verify the initial deposit. They assured me it was secure.

Advisor: I see. Sharing your credentials may have allowed them to access your account. Let me reset your online banking credentials immediately to secure your account. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 3642.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll process that now. While I’m doing this, let’s also discuss steps to recover your funds and protect your information. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: First, I’ll initiate a dispute for the payments made to this platform. We’ll work with the receiving bank to attempt recovery. Please note that the process can take up to 15 business days, and success depends on whether the funds are still available in the recipient’s account.

Customer: I understand. Do I need to provide anything for the investigation?

Advisor: It would help if you could provide any evidence of your communication with the platform, such as emails, messages, or screenshots of your account. Could you email those to us?

Customer: Yes, I’ll gather everything and send it over.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll email you the details for submitting your evidence after the call. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide you with a reference number, which we can use for our investigation.

Customer: I’ll contact them as well. Thank you.

Advisor: Let’s also talk about recognizing and avoiding scams like this in the future. Fraudulent investment platforms often use high-pressure tactics and promises of unrealistic returns to lure victims. Did the platform guarantee specific profits or use any time-limited offers?

Customer: Yes, they said I could double my money in two weeks and that the offer was only available for a short time.

Advisor: That’s a common tactic used by fraudsters. Genuine investment opportunities don’t guarantee returns or pressure you to act quickly. I’ll include more tips in the follow-up email on how to verify investment opportunities.

Customer: That would be really helpful. I’ll be much more cautious next time.

Advisor: Before we finish, let’s also enable two-factor authentication for your online banking to enhance security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be great.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in the follow-up email. Additionally, I recommend changing the passwords for your email and any other accounts where you’ve used the same credentials. Would you like guidance on creating secure passwords?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, it’s important to monitor your credit report for any unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken today. I’ve flagged the payments to the fraudulent account and initiated a dispute process with the receiving bank. I’ve advised you to report the incident to Action Fraud and provided guidance on securing your account and recognizing investment scams in the future. I’ve also recommended enabling two-factor authentication, updating your passwords, and monitoring your credit report. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Taylor. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have any further concerns, don’t hesitate to contact us. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
