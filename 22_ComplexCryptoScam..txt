
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Marcus. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Claire Johnson.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 19th November 1988, and my postcode is SW19 8AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency scheme, and at first, everything seemed fine. But now I can’t access my account, and I’ve lost contact with the company. They’ve taken a lot of my money.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Ms. Johnson. Let’s look into this together. Could you start by explaining how you first came across this scheme?

Customer: I saw an ad online, claiming to be a partnership with a celebrity. It said people were doubling their money through crypto investments, so I clicked on it and signed up.

Advisor: Thank you. What happened after you signed up? Did they contact you directly?

Customer: Yes, they called me almost immediately. The representative explained how their platform worked and walked me through making my first deposit. They even helped me set up a wallet.

Advisor: I see. How much did you initially deposit, and what payment method did you use?

Customer: My first deposit was £500, which I paid using my debit card.

Advisor: Understood. And after that initial payment, what happened?

Customer: I started seeing profits on their dashboard within a week. They kept calling, encouraging me to invest more to see bigger returns. Eventually, I transferred a total of £20,000 in multiple payments.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Did they provide any documentation, such as investment statements or proof of your account’s balance?

Customer: Yes, they sent me statements showing my account balance growing. It all looked very professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you first suspect something might be wrong?

Customer: Last week. I tried to withdraw some of my profits, and they told me I needed to pay a “tax fee” of £3,000 before I could access my money. That’s when I started feeling uneasy.

Advisor: Did you pay the tax fee?

Customer: No, I didn’t. I asked why I couldn’t deduct it from my account balance, and they got defensive. Now I can’t log in to the platform, and they’ve stopped responding to my emails and calls.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like you’ve been targeted in a complex crypto scam. Let me review your account and cross-check the payments you’ve made to this platform. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Johnson. I’ve identified several transactions linked to the platform. Many of the recipient accounts are flagged in our system for fraudulent activity. I’ll escalate this case to our investigations team and initiate recovery attempts for your funds. Before proceeding, I’ll need to ask some additional questions to build a complete profile of the scam. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you confirm whether you had any direct communication with the platform outside of phone calls and emails, such as through messaging apps or social media?

Customer: Yes, they asked me to join a WhatsApp group where they shared updates and tips about crypto trading.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you notice anything unusual about the group, such as overly positive reviews or pressure tactics?

Customer: Yes, everyone in the group kept talking about how much money they were making. It felt like they were trying to convince me to invest more.

Advisor: I understand. Fraudsters often use fake testimonials to create a false sense of legitimacy. Did they ever ask you to download any software or apps?

Customer: Yes, they had me install an app called “CryptoEdge” to monitor my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. I’ll also provide guidance on securing your devices further. Did the fraudsters request any personal information, such as your ID or banking details?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my passport and proof of address for “verification.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. I’ll guide you on protecting your identity after we secure your account. Let’s focus on minimizing further risks and recovering your funds.

Advisor: I’ve secured your account, flagged the unauthorized transactions, and blocked further access to the flagged accounts. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide some advice to help you avoid scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Of course. Crypto scams often promise high returns with minimal risk, which is a red flag. Always verify the legitimacy of investment platforms by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying trustworthy platforms?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for any unusual activity, as the fraudsters may use the identification documents you provided to commit identity theft. Signing up for a credit monitoring service is a good step.

Customer: Okay, I’ll look into that.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: I’ll contact them right away.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the transactions linked to the scam, secured your account, and initiated the recovery process. I’ve also provided guidance on protecting your identity and avoiding scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Johnson. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
