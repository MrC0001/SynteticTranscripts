Customer: Yes, it’s Jonathan Carter.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Carter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 25th October 1979, and my postcode is N1 4RG.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency platform, but now I can’t withdraw my money. When I try to contact them, I don’t get any response, and I’ve already transferred a lot of money.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Carter. You’ve taken the right step by contacting us. Let’s investigate this together. Could you start by telling me how you found out about the platform?

Customer: It was through an ad on social media. It promised high returns on cryptocurrency investments and seemed legitimate. I clicked the link, and it took me to a professional-looking website.

Advisor: Thank you. What happened after you visited the website? Did you create an account?

Customer: Yes, I signed up and deposited an initial £500. I started seeing profits almost immediately on their dashboard, so I decided to invest more.

Advisor: I see. How much have you invested in total, and how were the payments made?

Customer: About £18,000 over several weeks. The first few payments were through my debit card, but then they asked me to transfer directly to their bank account to “avoid fees.”

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation, such as account statements or contracts?

Customer: Yes, they sent me weekly statements showing my profits growing. They even had a customer support team that reassured me when I asked questions.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Fraudulent platforms often use fake profit dashboards and supportive representatives to build trust. When did you first realize something might be wrong?

Customer: Last week, when I tried to withdraw some of my profits. They said I needed to pay a “release fee” of £2,000 before I could access my funds.

Advisor: Did you pay the release fee?

Customer: No, that’s when I got suspicious. They started pressuring me, saying I’d lose everything if I didn’t pay.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like you’ve been targeted in a crypto investment scam. Let me review the transactions linked to this platform and cross-check the recipient accounts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve identified the payments you made to the platform. I can see several transactions to flagged accounts associated with fraudulent activity. I’ll need to escalate this to our investigations team and initiate recovery requests. Before proceeding, I’ll need to ask some additional questions. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you had any direct communication with the platform’s representatives outside of the website, such as phone calls or messages through another app?

Customer: Yes, they called me regularly to discuss investment strategies. They even suggested I invest in specific cryptocurrencies through their platform.

Advisor: Understood. Did the representatives use professional language, or did anything about their tone seem unusual?

Customer: They sounded professional, but they were very persistent. They kept saying I needed to act quickly to “seize opportunities.”

Advisor: Thank you. Did they ever ask you to download any software or apps?

Customer: Yes, they asked me to install an app called “CryptoSecure” to monitor my investments. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software on your devices?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. I’ll provide guidance on securing your devices further. Did they request access to any personal information, such as your ID or banking details?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my driver’s license for “verification purposes.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use personal identification to commit identity theft. I’ll guide you on protecting your identity after we secure your account. Let’s focus on blocking further access and recovering your funds.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions and secured your account. I’ve also enabled enhanced fraud monitoring to prevent further attempts. While our investigations team works on recovery, I’d like to provide some advice to help you avoid scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I don’t want this to happen again.

Advisor: Of course. Investment scams often promise high returns with minimal risk, which is a red flag. Always verify the legitimacy of investment platforms by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying trustworthy platforms?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, it’s a good idea to monitor your credit report for any unusual activity, as the fraudsters may use the information you provided to commit identity theft. I recommend signing up for a credit monitoring service.

Customer: Okay, I’ll look into that.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. They specialize in investigating scams like these and can provide a reference number for your case. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040.

Customer: I’ll contact them right away.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the transactions linked to the scam, secured your account, and initiated the recovery process. I’ve also provided guidance on protecting your identity and avoiding scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Carter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
