Customer: Yes, it’s Emma Johnson.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Johnson. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 24th October 1991, and my postcode is M1 4AN.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I can’t log into my online banking, and I’ve noticed emails about transactions that I didn’t authorize. I think someone’s taken over my account.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Johnson. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining when you first noticed something was wrong?

Customer: It started yesterday. I got an email saying there was suspicious activity on my account and asking me to verify my identity. I clicked the link and logged in, but now I think it was fake.

Advisor: Thank you. It does sound like you may have fallen victim to a phishing attempt. Did the website you were directed to look like our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same. I didn’t realize anything was wrong until this morning when I couldn’t log in.

Advisor: Understood. Let me check for any unauthorized access or suspicious activity on your account. Could you hold for a moment while I review your recent transactions?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Johnson. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from an overseas IP address. There are also several transactions that appear unauthorized. Do you recognize a £2,500 transfer to an unfamiliar account, £1,200 in online purchases, or a £5,000 payment to a cryptocurrency platform?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first school?”

Customer: It’s Greenfield Primary.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 8391.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the email you received. Did it include any urgency, such as warnings about your account being locked or suspended?

Customer: Yes, it said my account would be frozen if I didn’t verify my identity immediately.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic in phishing scams. Did the email ask you to provide any additional information, such as your National Insurance number or personal details?

Customer: Yes, it asked for my full name, date of birth, and even my address.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s likely the fraudsters used this information to access your account. Did you receive any texts or phone calls around the same time?

Customer: Yes, I got a call from someone claiming to be from your fraud team. They said they needed to verify a transaction and asked for a one-time passcode.

Advisor: Thank you. It sounds like the fraudsters used a combination of phishing and social engineering to gain access to your account. Did you provide them with the passcode?

Customer: Yes, I did. I thought it was part of the verification process.

Advisor: Understood. Let me check for additional suspicious activity and review the devices linked to your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Johnson. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account. Have you shared your login details with anyone else, or installed any new apps recently?

Customer: No, I haven’t shared my details, but I did install an app called “SecureBank” that was recommended in the email.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. I’ve also removed the flagged devices from your account and included these details in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance to help prevent this from happening again. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for falling for this.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Johnson. These scams are designed to appear legitimate and exploit trust. Moving forward, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen information can be used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Johnson. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
