Customer: Yes, it’s Helen Parker.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Parker. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th December 1968, and my postcode is PL1 3AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I received a call from someone claiming to be the police. They said my bank account had been compromised and that I needed to move my money to a “safe account.” I transferred the funds as instructed, but now I think it was a scam.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Parker. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining what the caller said and how they convinced you to act?

Customer: The caller said they were from my local police station and that my account had been flagged for suspicious activity. They said the safest option was to move my funds to a new account they provided while they “investigated.”

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you transfer, and were the payments made in one transaction or multiple?

Customer: I transferred £12,000 in total, split into three payments. They said it was to avoid raising any further red flags.

Advisor: Understood. Did they ask for any additional information, such as your online banking credentials?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my login details to “monitor” the account. They also asked for the one-time passcodes sent to my phone.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you noticed any other unauthorized transactions or unusual activity on your account?

Customer: Yes, there’s a £3,000 transfer I didn’t authorize, along with several smaller payments.

Advisor: Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Parker. I’ve identified the £12,000 you mentioned, as well as the £3,000 transfer and smaller payments totaling £1,200. Do you recognize any of these additional transactions?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first school?”

Customer: It’s St. Mary’s Primary.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4321.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the caller further. Did they provide any credentials, such as a badge number or department details, to make the call seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they gave me a badge number and said they were from the fraud division. They even told me to call 999 to verify, but they must have kept the line open.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use techniques like keeping the line open to appear credible. Did they create any urgency or pressure to convince you to act quickly?

Customer: Yes, they said my money was at immediate risk and that any delay could result in its loss.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any notifications from the bank about new devices or changes to your account after providing your login details?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a new device logging in, but I thought it was related to their “monitoring.”

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Parker. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged and removed several suspicious payees. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for my email and a shopping app.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Parker. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
