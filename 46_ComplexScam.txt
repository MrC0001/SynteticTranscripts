Customer: Yes, it’s David Brown.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Brown. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 19th January 1974, and my postcode is S10 5AG.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I received a call from someone claiming to be from your fraud team. They said my account was at risk and convinced me to transfer money to a safe account. Now I’ve lost access to my online banking, and I think they’ve taken my money.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Brown. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining what happened during the call?

Customer: They said they were from your fraud department and that my account had been targeted by hackers. They knew my name, address, and some recent transactions, so I believed them. They told me I needed to transfer my money to a safe account while they secured my account.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any additional details, such as a reference number or specific account information?

Customer: Yes, they gave me a reference number and the details of the account I was supposed to transfer to. They also said the transfer needed to be done immediately to avoid losing my funds.

Advisor: I understand. How much did you transfer, and how was the payment made?

Customer: I transferred £28,000 in two separate transactions using my online banking. They stayed on the line while I made the payments.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they ask for any additional information, such as your login credentials or one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, they asked me to verify my identity by providing my online banking login and some codes I received via text.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the fraudsters used a combination of tactics to gain access to your account. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Brown. I’ve located the transactions you mentioned, and they were sent to flagged accounts associated with fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from unfamiliar devices, including one from abroad. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t.

Advisor: It suggests that your account may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What was your first car?”

Customer: It was a Ford Fiesta.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4921.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the call you received. Did they create any urgency or mention legal consequences if you didn’t comply?

Customer: Yes, they said my account would be frozen immediately if I didn’t act, and they hinted that I could be held responsible if the hackers succeeded.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency and fear is a common tactic in scams like these. Did they follow up after the payments were made?

Customer: Yes, they called again and said everything was secure, but then I couldn’t log into my online banking this morning.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s discuss the unauthorized login attempts. Did you receive any emails or texts asking you to verify your account or provide further details?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying there was suspicious activity on my account. It asked me to log in and verify some transactions.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the email was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to look like our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Brown. I’ve identified several other unauthorized transactions on your account, including a £3,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency platform and £1,500 in online purchases. Do you recognize these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. I’ve also removed the flagged devices from your account. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen personal information can be used for further fraud. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Brown. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
