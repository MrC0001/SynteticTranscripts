Customer: Yes, it’s David Harris.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Harris. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 3rd March 1979, and my postcode is LE1 6AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I own a small business, and we recently received an email from one of our suppliers asking for payment to a new bank account. We made the transfer, but now the supplier says they didn’t receive the funds. I think we’ve been scammed.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Harris. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the email and what it said?

Customer: The email looked like it came from our usual supplier. It included an updated invoice with new bank account details. It seemed normal, so we processed the payment of £15,000 as instructed.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your supplier’s, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: At first glance, it looked fine, but when I checked later, I noticed an extra letter in the domain name.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any further communication after making the payment?

Customer: No, but the supplier contacted us to ask why we hadn’t paid. That’s when I realized something was wrong.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you noticed any other unauthorized transactions or unusual activity on your account?

Customer: Yes, there’s a £5,000 transfer I didn’t authorize and some smaller payments I don’t recognize.

Advisor: Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Harris. I’ve identified the £15,000 payment to the fraudulent account, as well as the £5,000 transfer and smaller payments totaling £2,000. Do you recognize any of these additional transactions?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Rocky.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 5289.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the fraudulent email further. Did it include any specific urgency or pressure to make the payment quickly?

Customer: Yes, it said the payment was overdue and needed to be processed immediately to avoid late fees.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the invoice itself look genuine, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked like our usual invoices, with the same logo and formatting. That’s why I didn’t suspect anything.

Advisor: Understood. Have you received any notifications from the bank about new devices or changes to your account settings?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a new device logging in, but I assumed it was my business partner.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Harris. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an overseas IP address. I’ve also flagged several suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for our business email account.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised email credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend contacting your supplier to confirm their legitimate payment details and inform them of the fraud. They may require a police reference number, which you can obtain by reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report and your company’s accounts for unusual activity, as your personal and business details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on monitoring your credit and implementing additional security measures for your business?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and addressing the fraudulent payment. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Harris. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
