Customer: Yes, it’s Andrew Miller.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Miller. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th August 1974, and the postcode is M2 4JJ.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think someone’s taken over my account. I can’t log in anymore, and I’ve noticed multiple emails from your bank about transactions I didn’t authorize. I’m really worried.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Miller. Let me assure you that you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by telling me when you first noticed something unusual?

Customer: It started yesterday afternoon. I got a text saying there was suspicious activity on my account and asking me to confirm some details. I clicked the link, entered my login info, and thought it was resolved. Then this morning, I couldn’t access my account, and I saw emails about payments I didn’t make.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It’s possible that text was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to resemble our official banking site?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical. That’s why I didn’t question it.

Advisor: I understand. Fraudsters often create convincing replicas of official sites to steal login credentials. Let me review your account for any suspicious activity and secure it immediately. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Miller. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. There’s a £3,500 transfer to a new payee, £1,200 in online purchases, and a £500 cash withdrawal made from a different location. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Rocky.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 2971.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s start with the phishing text you received. Did the sender’s number appear to be from the bank, or was it a generic number?

Customer: It looked like it came from the bank. The sender’s name in the text was “[Bank Name],” so I thought it was legitimate.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often spoof official numbers to make their messages seem authentic. Did the text include any urgency, such as warnings about account suspension or immediate action required?

Customer: Yes, it said my account would be frozen if I didn’t respond within an hour.

Advisor: I see. Creating urgency is a common tactic used to pressure victims. Did you notice anything unusual in your email around the same time, such as password change notifications or login attempts from new devices?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying my password had been changed, but I thought it was part of the process.

Advisor: Thank you. It sounds like the fraudsters used the information you entered to access your account and change the credentials. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or notifications about the payments being processed?

Customer: Yes, I got confirmation emails for the payments, but I didn’t think they were real at first because I couldn’t log in to check.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use your email to complete account takeovers, including approving new payees and transactions. Let’s move on to securing your account further. Did you share any other sensitive information, such as your National Insurance number or personal ID, with the fraudsters?

Customer: No, just my login details.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the fraudsters request that you download any apps or software during the process?

Customer: No, they didn’t ask for that.

Advisor: That’s good to know. I’ll now review the devices and IP addresses recently used to access your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Miller. I can see several login attempts from devices in different locations, including one from abroad. Have you traveled recently or used your online banking while outside the UK?

Customer: No, I haven’t been abroad.

Advisor: Thank you. This confirms that unauthorized access occurred. I’ll include these details in the investigation and block those devices from future access. Let’s focus on recovering the funds and preventing further unauthorized activity.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide advice on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Of course. To prevent phishing attacks, always verify the sender’s information and avoid clicking on links in unsolicited messages. If you’re unsure, contact us directly using the number on the back of your debit card. Would you like me to send you a guide on recognizing phishing attempts?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance with setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that as well. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as fraudsters may attempt identity theft. Would you like guidance on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Miller. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
