Customer: Yes, it’s Emma Davies.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Davies. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 3rd March 1987, and my postcode is ME15 7PX.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve received a letter saying my account is under investigation for suspected involvement in fraud. I don’t understand what’s happening—I’ve only been helping someone I met online. They asked me to transfer some money for them, but now I’m really worried.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Davies. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you met this person and what they asked you to do?

Customer: I met him on a dating site about four months ago. He said he was working overseas and had issues accessing his bank account. He asked if he could transfer some money to me and then have me forward it to his family.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any additional details or documents to explain why he needed your help?

Customer: Yes, he sent me pictures of his passport and bank account statements. He said it was temporary and promised to repay me for the trouble.

Advisor: Understood. How much money was transferred to your account, and where did you send it?

Customer: Over the past three months, he’s sent about £50,000 in several transactions. He gave me different account details each time to forward the money, mostly to international accounts.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he ask for any personal information from you, such as your account details or passwords?

Customer: Yes, he asked for my online banking credentials once, saying he needed to verify something. I gave them to him but changed the password afterward.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Let me review your account for any suspicious activity and check the flagged transactions. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Davies. I’ve identified the transactions you mentioned, and I can see several other payments that appear suspicious. These include transfers totaling £15,000 to flagged accounts associated with money laundering. Do you recognize any of these transactions?

Customer: No, those aren’t mine. I only made the transfers he asked for.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your favorite teacher?”

Customer: It’s Mr. Jenkins.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 6724.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the communication with this individual further. Did he use any urgency or threats to convince you to make the transfers?

Customer: Yes, he said the money was for his sick mother and that delays could prevent her from getting medical care. It felt like an emergency every time.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he ask for access to your account again after the first time, or did you notice any unfamiliar logins?

Customer: No, but I did get a text about a new device logging in. I assumed it was an error because I’d changed my password.

Advisor: Understood. Did he ever ask you to receive or withdraw cash on his behalf?

Customer: Yes, he asked me to withdraw £5,000 and send it through a courier service. I thought it was odd, but he said it was faster than a bank transfer.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for additional suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Davies. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from a foreign IP address. I’ve also flagged additional suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for a couple of shopping apps.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or phishing attempt. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions on securing your account and linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and managing the ongoing investigation. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Davies. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
