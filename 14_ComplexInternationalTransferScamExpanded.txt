Customer: Yes, it’s Robert Stevens.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Stevens. Can you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 10th March 1975, and the postcode is E2 8HJ.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I tried to make an international payment this morning for my business, but it got blocked. I received a notification saying the transaction was flagged for review, and I’m not sure why.

Advisor: I’m sorry for the inconvenience, Mr. Stevens. Let me investigate this for you. Could you provide some details about the payment? What was the amount, and to which country were you trying to send it?

Customer: It was for £50,000, and I was sending it to a supplier in Germany.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you confirm whether this is a supplier you’ve dealt with before, or is this a new business relationship?

Customer: It’s a new supplier. We recently signed a contract for some equipment, and this was the first payment.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive the payment details directly from the supplier, and if so, how were they provided?

Customer: Yes, they sent the invoice and bank details through email.

Advisor: Thank you. Before the payment was blocked, did you notice anything unusual about the supplier’s communication, such as changes in their email address, tone, or payment instructions?

Customer: Now that you mention it, they did change their bank details last week. They said it was due to switching to a new bank.

Advisor: I see. Did you verify this change directly with the supplier through a different communication method, like a phone call?

Customer: No, I didn’t. The email looked legitimate, so I went ahead with it.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Fraudsters often compromise email accounts or spoof addresses to send fake invoices with altered bank details. This is particularly common with international payments, where verification is more challenging. I’ll review the details of the transaction and the recipient account now. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Stevens. I can see that the payment was flagged by our system because the recipient account in Germany has been associated with suspicious activity. This raises a red flag for potential invoice fraud. I’ll need to ask you a few more questions to understand the full scope of the situation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. You mentioned that the supplier recently changed their bank details. Could you describe how the new details were communicated? Was it through the same email thread you used previously, or did the email address or format change?

Customer: It was in the same email thread. The address looked the same as before, and they used the company logo and everything.

Advisor: I understand. Fraudsters can be very convincing, often using the same email thread and replicating legitimate email formats. When you received the new bank details, did the email include any unusual language or urgency, such as requesting quick payment to secure a deal?

Customer: Yes, actually. They said we needed to make the payment within 48 hours to avoid delays in the shipment.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Creating a sense of urgency is a common tactic used by fraudsters to bypass standard verification procedures. I’ll proceed with securing your account and initiating a deeper investigation. To start, I’ll block any further transactions to the flagged account and reset your online banking credentials. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ve completed those actions. While I continue the investigation, I’d like to ask about any other communications you’ve had with this supplier. Have you spoken to them over the phone or had any other forms of communication besides email?

Customer: We’ve had a couple of phone calls, but those were before the bank detail change. After that, it’s only been through email.

Advisor: Understood. I recommend contacting the supplier directly using a trusted phone number—preferably one you’ve used before—to verify whether the bank detail change was legitimate. Fraudsters often avoid phone communication, so speaking directly with the supplier can provide clarity.

Customer: I’ll do that.

Advisor: Great. I also recommend implementing additional verification steps for future payments, especially with new suppliers or international transactions. Always verify any changes in payment details directly through multiple communication channels. Would you like me to send you a guide on best practices for verifying payment information?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, could you confirm whether your company’s email system has security measures like two-factor authentication or anti-phishing tools in place?

Customer: I’m not sure. I’ll need to check with our IT department.

Advisor: That’s a good idea. Implementing strong email security can help prevent incidents like this in the future. I also recommend notifying your IT team to review your email system for any signs of compromise, such as unauthorized logins or suspicious emails.

Customer: I’ll make sure they do that.

Advisor: Let’s proceed with the recovery process. I’ll escalate this case to our fraud investigations team, who will work with the recipient bank in Germany to attempt to recall the funds. While we can’t guarantee the outcome, the fact that the payment was flagged quickly increases the likelihood of a successful recovery.

Customer: That’s good to hear. Do you think we’ll be able to get the money back?

Advisor: We’ll do everything we can to recover the funds. The international nature of the transaction can make recovery more complex, but our team is experienced in handling these cases. I’ll keep you updated on the progress.

Customer: Thank you. Is there anything else I should do in the meantime?

Advisor: Yes, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre. They can investigate further and provide you with a reference number, which you can share with us. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040.

Customer: Okay, I’ll do that.

Advisor: Great. Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transaction, reset your online banking credentials, and provided guidance on verifying payment details and improving email security. Our investigations team will work on recovering the funds, and I’ll keep you updated throughout the process. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Stevens. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
