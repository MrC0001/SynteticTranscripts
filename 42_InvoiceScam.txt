Customer: Yes, it’s Richard Davies.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Davies. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 9th September 1975, and my postcode is CV1 2GT.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think we’ve been scammed at my business. We paid an invoice to one of our suppliers, but they’re saying they never sent it. Now I can’t access my online banking, and I’m seeing emails about payments I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Davies. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by explaining how you received the invoice?

Customer: It came through email, just like all our other invoices from this supplier. It looked completely legitimate with their logo and details. It even referenced the correct purchase order number.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your supplier’s usual contact, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked identical at first, but I noticed later that the domain name had an extra character. It was something like “[suppliername.co.uk]” but with an added “s.”

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use lookalike email addresses to impersonate legitimate contacts. Did the invoice mention any changes to the supplier’s usual bank details?

Customer: Yes, it said their account had changed due to an audit and provided a new bank account number.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was the payment, and how was it made?

Customer: It was £150,000, transferred directly from our business account.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review the payment details and check for any other suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Davies. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from unfamiliar devices. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t. What does that mean?

Advisor: It suggests that your account credentials may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite sport?”

Customer: It’s rugby.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 7625.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll secure your business account and then address the unauthorized activity. While I work on this, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the invoice. Did it include any urgency, such as warnings about overdue payments or penalties?

Customer: Yes, it said the payment was overdue and that we needed to act immediately to avoid late fees.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in invoice scams to bypass verification processes. Did you attempt to verify the new payment details with your supplier before transferring the funds?

Customer: No, we didn’t. The email seemed so legitimate, and we’ve been dealing with this supplier for years.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw several transfers to accounts I don’t recognize, totaling over £20,000. There’s also a £10,000 payment to a cryptocurrency exchange.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you receive any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, about a week ago, I got an email saying there was suspicious activity on my account. It included a link to log in and verify my details.

Advisor: Thank you. It sounds like the email was part of a phishing attack designed to capture your credentials. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Davies. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from overseas. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance to help prevent this from happening again. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Great. Invoice fraud often involves email compromise or spoofing. Moving forward, I recommend always verifying payment details with suppliers directly, using a trusted phone number. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. We’ll put that in place immediately.

Advisor: Excellent. I also recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your company’s payment authorization process. Implementing dual authorization for high-value transactions can prevent similar incidents. Would you like guidance on that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Davies. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
