Customer: Yes, it’s Daniel Wright.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Wright. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 4th July 1983, and my postcode is NE3 4RT.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve noticed several unauthorized transactions on my account, and I received a notification about a new open banking connection I didn’t set up. I also think someone might have accessed my cryptocurrency wallet because my funds are gone.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Wright. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining when you first noticed something unusual?

Customer: It started two days ago. I got an email saying a new third-party app was connected to my bank account through open banking. I didn’t authorize it, but I thought it might be an error, so I ignored it. Then, yesterday, I saw multiple transactions I didn’t recognize.

Advisor: Thank you. Do you remember the name of the third-party app mentioned in the notification?

Customer: Yes, it was something like “PayQuick Services.”

Advisor: Understood. Let me review your account for any unauthorized transactions or connections. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Wright. I’ve identified several suspicious transactions and an active connection to the third-party app you mentioned. There’s a £3,000 payment to a cryptocurrency exchange, a £2,500 transfer to another flagged account, and multiple smaller transactions. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite color?”

Customer: It’s blue.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 6172.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the open banking connection further. Did you recently download any apps or sign up for new services that could have accessed your banking information?

Customer: No, but I did receive an email last week asking me to verify my account for “enhanced security.” It looked like it was from your bank, so I clicked the link and entered my login details.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It sounds like the email was a phishing attempt designed to capture your credentials. After you entered your details, did you notice any other unusual activity or receive any follow-up emails?

Customer: Yes, I got a confirmation email about a “successful security update.” I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s move on to your cryptocurrency wallet. Could you explain how you manage it and what’s happened?

Customer: I use an app called “CryptoSecure” to manage my wallet. Yesterday, I logged in and found that all my funds, about £12,000, were gone. I don’t understand how they accessed it.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you use the same email and password for your crypto wallet as your online banking?

Customer: Yes, I did. I realize now that might not have been a good idea.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. It’s possible the fraudsters used the stolen credentials to access both your bank account and crypto wallet. Did you enable two-factor authentication for your wallet?

Customer: No, I didn’t.

Advisor: I see. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Wright. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from a foreign IP address. Have you shared your credentials with anyone else or experienced any recent data breaches?

Customer: No, I haven’t shared them, but I did get an email about a data breach from another service I use last month.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s likely your credentials were compromised in the breach. I’ve removed the unauthorized devices from your account and blocked the flagged open banking connection. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend contacting the cryptocurrency platform where your funds were transferred. They may be able to assist with tracking the transactions. Would you like guidance on how to proceed with them?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed steps in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security, contacting cryptocurrency platforms, and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Wright. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
