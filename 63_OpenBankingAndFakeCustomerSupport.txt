Customer: Yes, it’s Lisa Matthews.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Matthews. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th September 1988, and my postcode is RG1 3DP.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I got a call from someone claiming to be from your customer support team. They said my account had been flagged for suspicious activity and needed urgent verification. I gave them some information, but now I’ve noticed payments I didn’t make, and I got an alert about a new open banking connection.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Matthews. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the call began and what they said?

Customer: The caller said they were from your fraud department and that someone had attempted to make a large transfer from my account. They sounded very professional and knew my name and the last four digits of my account number.

Advisor: Thank you. What instructions did they give, and what information did they request?

Customer: They asked me to confirm my account by providing a one-time passcode that they said they were sending to my phone. I thought it was part of the security process, so I gave them the code.

Advisor: Understood. Did they request any additional details, such as your full login credentials or personal information?

Customer: Yes, they asked for my online banking password and answers to my security questions to “verify” my identity. I gave them everything because I thought I was speaking to someone from the bank.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like the fraudsters used social engineering to gain access to your account. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Matthews. I’ve identified several unauthorized transactions on your account. These include a £4,000 transfer to a flagged account, £2,500 to a cryptocurrency platform, and smaller payments totaling £1,200. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite book?”

Customer: It’s To Kill a Mockingbird.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 2871.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the open banking connection you mentioned. Did the caller mention this, or did you notice it in your account activity?

Customer: I only saw the alert after the call. It said a new app called “PayTrack Solutions” was connected to my account. I didn’t authorize it.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the caller ask you to approve any notifications or send additional codes after the first one?

Customer: Yes, they sent me another notification to “confirm” the removal of fraudulent payees. I approved it, thinking it was part of the process.

Advisor: Understood. It’s likely the fraudsters used those approvals to establish the open banking connection. Did you receive any follow-up communication from them after the call?

Customer: Yes, they sent an email thanking me for cooperating and saying my account was secure.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for additional suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Matthews. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from a foreign IP address. I’ve also flagged the open banking connection and initiated its removal. Have you used your banking credentials on any other platforms recently?

Customer: No, but I reuse my password for some apps like budgeting tools.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters used stolen credentials from another platform to impersonate you. I recommend uninstalling any apps linked to the fraud and running a full security scan on your devices. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your open banking connections regularly and revoking access for any apps you don’t recognize. Would you like guidance on how to do that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed steps in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, removed the fraudulent open banking connection, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and managing your open banking connections. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Matthews. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
