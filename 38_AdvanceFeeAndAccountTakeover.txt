Customer: Yes, it’s Robert Jenkins.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Jenkins. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 3rd April 1968, and my postcode is SE4 8TR.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I was contacted by a loan company offering me a personal loan. They said I needed to pay some fees upfront, and now I can’t reach them. To make things worse, I’ve noticed several transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Jenkins. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by explaining how the loan company contacted you?

Customer: I got a text message a couple of weeks ago saying I was pre-approved for a £15,000 loan. It included a link to apply, which I clicked on. The website looked professional, so I filled in my details.

Advisor: Thank you. After submitting your details, what happened next?

Customer: Someone called me within an hour. They said I’d been approved, but to release the funds, I needed to pay a £300 processing fee. They also said there might be additional charges for taxes.

Advisor: I see. How did you make the payment, and were there further requests for money?

Customer: I paid the processing fee via bank transfer. Then they said there was an “insurance fee” of £500 and a final “legal clearance fee” of £1,000. I paid those too, thinking the loan would be processed. After that, they stopped responding to my calls and emails.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any documentation, such as a loan agreement or receipts for the fees you paid?

Customer: Yes, they sent me a contract and confirmation emails. It all seemed legitimate at the time.

Advisor: Understood. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions on your account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: This morning, I saw several payments I didn’t recognize, including a £2,000 transfer and some smaller online purchases.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It’s possible the fraudsters gained access to your account after you provided your details. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Jenkins. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There’s also a £1,800 transfer to a flagged account and two smaller payments totaling £600. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Italy.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4732.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the initial text message you received. Did the sender’s number look legitimate, or was it a generic number?

Customer: It looked like a normal number. Nothing stood out as suspicious.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use spoofed numbers to appear authentic. Did the website you visited include any urgency, such as warnings about the offer expiring soon?

Customer: Yes, it said the offer was only valid for 48 hours.

Advisor: Understood. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in advance fee scams. Did the website ask for any sensitive information, such as your National Insurance number or bank details?

Customer: Yes, they asked for my bank account details to “set up the loan disbursement.”

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s likely they used this information to access your account. Did you receive any follow-up communications from them after you made the payments?

Customer: Just emails confirming the fees had been received. After the last payment, they went silent.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s talk about the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or texts asking you to verify your online banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying there was unusual activity on my account. It included a link to log in and verify my identity.

Advisor: Thank you. It sounds like the email was part of a phishing attempt. Did the website you were directed to resemble our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Jenkins. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from abroad. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for falling for this.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Mr. Jenkins. Advance fee scams are designed to appear legitimate and exploit trust. Moving forward, I recommend verifying the legitimacy of any loan offers by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying trustworthy lenders?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance with setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as fraudsters may attempt identity theft using the information they’ve obtained. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on avoiding similar scams and protecting your identity in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Jenkins. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
