Customer: Yes, it’s Anna White.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. White. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 14th November 1989, and my postcode is W3 2BQ.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I was contacted by a company offering me a personal loan. They said I needed to pay some fees upfront, and now they’re not responding to my calls. I’ve also noticed transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. White. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the company contacted you?

Customer: They sent me a text message saying I’d been pre-approved for a loan. It included a link to apply, which I clicked on. Their website looked professional, so I filled in my details.

Advisor: Thank you. After submitting your details, what happened next?

Customer: Someone called me within an hour. They said I was approved for a £15,000 loan but needed to pay a £300 processing fee to release the funds. After that, they asked for more payments for “insurance” and “legal fees.”

Advisor: I see. How much did you pay in total, and how were the payments made?

Customer: I paid about £1,800 altogether. They asked me to transfer the money to a bank account they provided. They said the loan would be processed within 24 hours, but now they’re not answering their phone or emails.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any documentation, such as a loan agreement or receipts for the payments?

Customer: Yes, they emailed me a loan contract and confirmations for the payments. It all looked legitimate.

Advisor: Understood. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw a £2,500 transfer to a cryptocurrency exchange and several smaller payments totaling about £1,000. I didn’t authorize any of them.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. White. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There’s also a £3,000 payment to another flagged account. Do you recognize these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite color?”

Customer: It’s blue.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 6234.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the company you interacted with. Did they ask for any personal identification, such as a passport or utility bill?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my ID to process the loan, so I sent them a copy of my driver’s license and a recent bank statement.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts or applying for credit. Did they ask you to download any apps or software?

Customer: No, they didn’t mention anything like that.

Advisor: That’s good to know. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or texts asking you to verify your banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, I got a text saying my account was locked and asking me to verify my identity. It included a link, which I clicked on.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the text was part of a phishing attempt designed to capture your credentials. Did the website you were directed to resemble our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. White. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from an international IP address. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID has likely been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. White. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
