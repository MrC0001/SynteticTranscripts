Customer: Yes, it’s David Campbell.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Campbell. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 3rd February 1978, and my postcode is SW1A 1AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’m calling about an email I got from someone claiming to be our company’s CEO. They instructed me to make an urgent payment for a deal. I followed their instructions, but it turns out the email was fake. Now I’ve noticed some transactions I didn’t authorize, and I can’t access my online banking.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Campbell. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the email and what it said?

Customer: The email came last Thursday. It looked like it was from our CEO’s usual address. It referenced an upcoming project we’ve been working on, so I thought it was legitimate. It instructed me to transfer £75,000 to secure the deal immediately.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any urgency or specific instructions to make it seem more convincing?

Customer: Yes, it said the payment needed to be processed within the hour and not to inform anyone because it was confidential. They even included a follow-up email asking for confirmation.

Advisor: Understood. How did you make the payment, and did they provide any specific details about the recipient?

Customer: I made the payment through our business account, directly to the bank details provided in the email. The account was under a company name that seemed related to the project.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any attachments or links, and did you interact with them?

Customer: Yes, it had an invoice attached and a link to “confirm payment security.” I clicked the link, which took me to a page that looked like your online banking portal. I logged in and confirmed the transaction.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like the fraudsters used phishing techniques alongside impersonation. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Campbell. I’ve located the payment you mentioned, and I can see several other unauthorized transactions. These include a £20,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency platform, £10,000 to a flagged account, and smaller payments totaling £5,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Greece.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 4829.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the email further. Did the sender’s address match your CEO’s exactly, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: At first glance, it looked the same, but when I checked later, I noticed there was an extra “-finance” added to the domain name.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use lookalike domains to deceive recipients. Did the email mention any additional contact details or provide follow-up instructions?

Customer: It included a phone number for the “finance team,” but I didn’t call it. They followed up with another email asking me to confirm the payment via the link.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any notifications or texts from the bank after you completed the payment?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a login from a new device, but I assumed it was related to the transaction.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Campbell. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. Have you used your credentials on any other platforms or shared them with anyone?

Customer: No, but I did reuse my password on a few accounts, including a cloud storage service that was recently hacked.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters used credentials from the data breach to access your account. I recommend uninstalling any apps linked to the fraud and running a full security scan on your devices. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend implementing dual authorization for high-value payments in your company’s process. This ensures no single person can authorize large transfers. Would you like guidance on how to set that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and implementing fraud prevention measures for your business. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Campbell. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
