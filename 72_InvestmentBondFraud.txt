Customer: Yes, it’s Charlotte Evans.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Evans. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 16th April 1976, and my postcode is M1 4FB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I invested in what I thought was a legitimate bond through a financial advisor I found online. I’ve now realized it was a scam, and there are unauthorized payments from my account that I didn’t make.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Evans. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you found this financial advisor and what they promised?

Customer: I saw an ad online offering high-interest bonds. It seemed legitimate, so I contacted the advisor. He promised returns of up to 10% annually, and it looked like a well-known investment platform.

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you invest, and how were the payments made?

Customer: I started with £20,000, which I transferred directly to an account they provided. Over the past three months, I’ve sent about £50,000 in total.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation or correspondence about the investment?

Customer: Yes, they sent detailed brochures and regular updates showing the bond’s growth. It all looked professional.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: I tried to withdraw some funds last week, and they said there were “administrative fees” of £5,000. I refused to pay, and now they’re not responding. That’s when I noticed payments on my account I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Evans. I’ve identified several unauthorized transactions, including a £15,000 transfer to a flagged account, £7,500 to a cryptocurrency platform, and smaller purchases totaling £3,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite childhood toy?”

Customer: It’s a teddy bear.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 8642.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the financial advisor further. Did they ask for any personal identification or access to your bank account?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my ID to open the bond account, so I sent them a copy of my passport. They also asked for my bank details to “set up direct payments.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs for further scams or identity theft. Did you notice any alerts about new devices or other changes to your online banking?

Customer: Yes, I got an email about a new device logging in. I didn’t recognize it but didn’t think much of it at the time.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Evans. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from a foreign IP address. I’ve also flagged suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for an investment app I signed up for last year.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or phishing attempt. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, initiated recovery processes for your funds, and provided guidance on improving your account security. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Evans. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
