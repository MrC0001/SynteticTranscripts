Customer: Yes, it’s Anthony Reid.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Reid. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 30th November 1978, and my postcode is LS2 9BA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I was trying to make a payment for a business loan I’m taking out, but the payment was blocked. It’s for £75,000, and it’s delaying the whole process.

Advisor: I understand the urgency, Mr. Reid. Let me investigate the issue for you right away. Could you confirm how you attempted to make the payment—was it through our app, online banking, or in-branch?

Customer: I used the mobile app. The account details were provided by the loan broker I’m working with.

Advisor: Thank you. Was this your first transaction with this broker or for this particular loan?

Customer: Yes, this is the first payment. They said it was a processing fee required to secure the loan amount.

Advisor: I see. Could you clarify how the broker provided the payment details—was it via email, text, or a phone call?

Customer: They emailed me the details after we had a phone conversation about the loan terms.

Advisor: Understood. Let me check the payment and review your account to understand why it was flagged. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Sure, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Reid. The payment was flagged because the account you were trying to send funds to is linked to a fraud warning in our system. Could you tell me more about this broker? How did you find them?

Customer: I was researching business loans online, and they contacted me after I submitted my details on a comparison website. They seemed professional, and their terms were better than others I’d seen.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Did they ask for any sensitive information, such as your ID, bank credentials, or any security codes, as part of the loan process?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my driver’s license and my online banking details to “confirm eligibility.” I thought it was standard for loans.

Advisor: I see. That raises some concerns. Fraudsters often impersonate legitimate brokers to collect sensitive information. Let me review the devices and activity associated with your account to ensure it hasn’t been compromised. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Reid. I’ve identified a suspicious login from an IP address outside of your usual locations, along with three unauthorized transactions totaling £5,000 to a merchant called “LoanSecure Assist.” Do you recognize that name?

Customer: No, I’ve never heard of them.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll block further transactions to this merchant and reset your online banking credentials immediately. Could you confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 6472.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll secure your account now. Additionally, I recommend reporting this broker to Action Fraud, as they may be part of a larger scam targeting businesses. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040.

Customer: I’ll do that. What about the loan? Does this mean I won’t be able to secure the funding?

Advisor: It’s possible the broker was not legitimate. I recommend contacting the comparison website where you submitted your details to verify if this broker is officially registered. They should also be able to provide alternate, verified loan providers.

Customer: That’s disappointing. I’ll reach out to them.

Advisor: Before moving forward with another loan application, I recommend enhancing your online security. Let’s start by enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in the follow-up email. Additionally, I suggest changing your email password and enabling two-factor authentication there as well, especially since sensitive information was sent to the broker. Would you like guidance on that too?

Customer: Yes, I didn’t realize my email could be compromised as well.

Advisor: It’s a common point of entry for fraudsters. I’ll include tips for securing your email account in the follow-up. Lastly, do you use the same password across multiple accounts?

Customer: Unfortunately, yes. I know I shouldn’t, but it’s hard to remember so many.

Advisor: That’s understandable. I’ll include a guide to using password managers to create and store unique, secure passwords for each account.

Advisor: Let’s also talk about recognizing legitimate loan providers. Always verify the broker’s credentials through official financial regulatory bodies, such as the Financial Conduct Authority’s register. Were you provided with any licensing information or references by this broker?

Customer: They mentioned they were FCA-approved, but I didn’t check it myself.

Advisor: It’s always a good idea to confirm those claims independently. In the follow-up, I’ll include instructions on how to verify financial institutions and brokers.

Customer: That would be helpful. I’ll be more cautious moving forward.

Advisor: To summarize, your payment was blocked because the account details were flagged as fraudulent. I’ve secured your online banking by resetting your credentials, flagged unauthorized transactions, and advised you to report the broker to Action Fraud. I’ve also recommended enhancing your account security, verifying brokers through official registries, and securing your email account. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Reid. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have further concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
