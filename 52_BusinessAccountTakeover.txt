Customer: Yes, it’s Rebecca Shaw.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Shaw. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 14th April 1977, and the postcode is E14 5AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: It’s about my business account. I noticed transactions I didn’t authorize and, when I tried to log in to online banking this morning, I couldn’t access the account. I think someone’s taken control of it.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Shaw. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining when you first noticed something unusual?

Customer: I saw an email last week saying there were issues with my account, and I needed to update my security details. I followed the instructions and logged in, but now I think it was a scam. Then, over the weekend, I saw multiple transactions I didn’t recognize.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email look like it came from us, and did it include any urgent instructions?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical to your emails. It said my account would be frozen if I didn’t act immediately.

Advisor: Understood. It sounds like the email was a phishing attempt designed to capture your credentials. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any suspicious activity on your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Shaw. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. These include a £15,000 transfer to an unfamiliar account, £7,500 to a flagged cryptocurrency platform, and £3,000 in smaller payments to various vendors. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Carter.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 4853.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the email you received. Did it direct you to a website, and if so, did the website resemble our online banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it took me to a website that looked exactly like yours. I didn’t notice anything unusual at the time.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use spoofed websites to steal credentials. Did the website ask for any additional information, such as your account details or security codes?

Customer: Yes, it asked for my account number, security question answers, and a one-time passcode. I thought it was part of the security update process.

Advisor: Understood. It’s likely the fraudsters used this information to access your account. Have you noticed any changes to your account settings, such as new payees being added?

Customer: I’m not sure, but I did receive text alerts about new payees last week.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Let me review the payees and devices linked to your account for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Shaw. I’ve identified several unauthorized payees added to your account, including the flagged accounts where the funds were transferred. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices. Have you shared your account details with anyone, or installed any new apps related to your business recently?

Customer: No, I haven’t shared my details, but I did install a budgeting app a few weeks ago.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s possible the app may have contributed to the compromise. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan on your devices. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks. Could you confirm if any employees or co-owners have access to your business account credentials?

Customer: No, I’m the only one with access.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, removed the suspicious payees, and blocked the flagged devices. I’ve also reset your online banking credentials and initiated recovery requests for the lost funds. While our investigation is underway, I’d like to provide guidance on enhancing your account security. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your email security, as phishing emails often originate from compromised accounts. Have you changed your email password recently?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: I recommend doing that immediately and enabling two-factor authentication for your email as well. Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen credentials can be used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account and email security. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Shaw. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
