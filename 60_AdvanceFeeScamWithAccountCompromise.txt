Customer: Yes, it’s Marcus Evans.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Evans. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 15th October 1980, and my postcode is LS6 2AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I was contacted by someone offering me a personal loan. They asked for fees upfront, but now I can’t reach them, and I’ve noticed some strange transactions on my account. I also can’t log in to online banking anymore.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Evans. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you were contacted and what they said?

Customer: I got a call from someone claiming to be from a financial services company. They said I was pre-approved for a loan of £20,000 but needed to pay a small processing fee upfront to secure it.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was the fee, and how was the payment made?

Customer: They asked for £400 initially, which I transferred using my online banking. After that, they said there were additional charges, like insurance and legal fees, so I ended up sending about £3,000 in total.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any documentation or contracts to make their offer seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they emailed me a loan agreement and a receipt for each payment I made. It all looked professional.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you realize something was wrong?

Customer: After the last payment, they said the loan would be released within 24 hours, but then they stopped answering my calls. The email address they gave me bounced back when I tried to contact them.

Advisor: Understood. You also mentioned unusual transactions on your account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, I got email alerts about a £5,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency platform and some smaller payments totaling around £2,500. I didn’t authorize any of these.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these transactions and check for any other suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Evans. I’ve identified the unauthorized transactions you mentioned, along with a £3,000 payment to another flagged account. I’ve also noticed multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t.

Advisor: It suggests that your account credentials may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your favorite teacher?”

Customer: It’s Mr. Jenkins.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 7812.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the loan scam further. Did they ask for any personal identification, such as a passport or utility bill?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed my ID to process the loan, so I sent them a copy of my driver’s license and a recent utility bill.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did they ask you to download any apps or software as part of the process?

Customer: Yes, they had me install an app called “SecureFinance” to track my loan status.

Advisor: Understood. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Evans. I’ve flagged multiple unauthorized payees added to your account, including the accounts used for the fraudulent transactions. I’ve also identified login attempts from international IP addresses. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID has likely been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Evans. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
