Customer: Yes, it’s James Fletcher.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Fletcher. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 11th March 1974, and the postcode is EC1A 4HY.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my company’s been hit by a scam. I received an email from a client asking us to make an urgent payment, but now they’re saying they never sent it. We’ve already transferred £75,000, and I’m really worried.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Fletcher. You’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this together. Could you start by telling me about the email? What did it say, and did it include any supporting documents?

Customer: The email came from what looked like our client’s address. It said they needed payment for an invoice urgently because their accounts were being audited. There was an attached invoice that matched their previous ones.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email thread include any prior correspondence, or did it seem like a new request?

Customer: It was part of an ongoing thread, which made it seem legitimate.

Advisor: I see. Could you confirm how you processed the payment? Did you use your company’s online banking system?

Customer: Yes, I logged in and made the payment to the account they provided in the email.

Advisor: Understood. Did the email mention why the account details had changed, or did they provide any other justification?

Customer: They said it was a temporary change because of their bank undergoing maintenance. It didn’t seem unusual at the time.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Fraudsters often compromise email accounts or spoof legitimate addresses to send requests like these. Let me check the recipient account details and review your recent transactions. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Fletcher. I can see the payment you mentioned, and it was sent to an account ending in 3429. This account is flagged in our system for suspected fraudulent activity. I’ll block any further transactions to this account and initiate a recovery request. Before I proceed, I’ll need to confirm some additional details. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you confirm whether you’ve had any direct communication with your client outside of this email, such as phone calls or messages through other platforms?

Customer: No, not recently. I was going to call them today, but then they emailed me saying they didn’t request any payments.

Advisor: I see. It’s possible their email account was compromised. Did you notice anything unusual about the email address, such as minor spelling differences or formatting issues?

Customer: Not that I noticed. It looked exactly like their usual address.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use spoofing techniques to replicate legitimate email addresses. Could you forward the email to our fraud team for review?

Customer: Yes, I’ll do that.

Advisor: Great. Let’s talk about your company’s email security. Do you use two-factor authentication or any phishing detection tools?

Customer: I think we use some basic filters, but I’m not sure about two-factor authentication.

Advisor: I recommend checking with your IT team to ensure your email accounts are secure. Compromised email systems are a common entry point for scams like this. Have you noticed any other unusual activity, such as unexpected login attempts or unauthorized changes to your emails?

Customer: Not that I’m aware of, but I’ll ask our IT team to investigate.

Advisor: That’s a good idea. Let’s move on to the next steps. I’ll escalate this case to our investigations team and work with the recipient bank to recover the funds. In the meantime, I’ll secure your account and set up enhanced fraud monitoring. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ve completed those actions. While we work on recovering the funds, I’d like to provide guidance on preventing similar incidents in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, definitely.

Advisor: Great. Business Email Compromise scams often involve fraudsters impersonating trusted contacts to request payments. Always verify payment requests directly with the sender through a trusted phone number or face-to-face communication, especially if they involve changes to account details. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I wish I’d called them before making the payment.

Advisor: That’s understandable. Fraudsters are very skilled at creating a sense of urgency to bypass standard verification procedures. Additionally, I recommend implementing two-factor authentication for all email accounts and training employees to recognize phishing attempts. Would you like me to send you a guide on improving your company’s security?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized payment, initiated a recovery request, and secured your account. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security and reporting the incident. Our investigations team will keep you updated on the progress. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Fletcher. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
