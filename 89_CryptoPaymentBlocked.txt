Customer: Hi, it’s Samantha Jenkins.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Jenkins. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 17th February 1990, and my postcode is E1 4AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I tried to transfer £15,000 to a cryptocurrency exchange, but the payment was blocked. It’s for an investment I’ve been working on, so I need it cleared as soon as possible.

Advisor: I understand how important this is for you, Ms. Jenkins. Let me investigate the issue. To clarify, was this the first time you’ve transferred funds to this exchange?

Customer: Yes, it’s my first time. I’ve just started investing in crypto, and the broker I’m working with sent me the account details for their exchange.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you let me know how you received these details—was it via email, text, or another method?

Customer: They sent it to me over WhatsApp after we had a phone call discussing the investment.

Advisor: I see. Let me check the payment details and investigate why it was flagged. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Sure.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Jenkins. I’ve reviewed the payment, and it was blocked because the account is flagged in our fraud prevention system. The details provided are linked to suspicious activity involving cryptocurrency scams. Could you tell me more about your broker and how you came across them?

Customer: I found them online—they run a crypto trading group. We had a couple of calls, and they showed me examples of their past investments. Everything seemed legit.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Did they ask for any personal information, such as your banking credentials or ID, as part of the investment process?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my passport for “verification purposes,” and they wanted my online banking details to “ensure the payment went through properly.”

Advisor: I see. That’s concerning. Fraudsters often impersonate legitimate brokers to gain access to sensitive information. Let me review your account for any other unusual activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Jenkins. I’ve identified several login attempts from unfamiliar IP addresses and two small unauthorized payments to a merchant called “CryptoHub Connect.” Do you recognize this name?

Customer: No, I’ve never heard of that before.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll block further transactions to this merchant and reset your online banking credentials immediately. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 9382.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll secure your account now. Additionally, I recommend reporting this broker to Action Fraud, as they may be operating a scam. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They can provide a reference number for your case.

Customer: I’ll do that. What about the payment I was trying to make? Is there any way to verify if it’s safe?

Advisor: I suggest contacting the exchange directly using verified contact information from their official website. If the broker is legitimate, they should be able to provide additional verification. However, based on the current flags, I recommend proceeding with extreme caution.

Customer: I’ll check with the exchange before making any further payments.

Advisor: That’s a good approach. Let’s also enable two-factor authentication on your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include instructions for enabling two-factor authentication in the follow-up email. Additionally, I recommend updating the passwords for any other accounts where you’ve used the same credentials as your banking login. Would you like guidance on creating strong passwords?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the follow-up as well. Before we wrap up, let me also ensure your mobile banking app is secure. Could you confirm if you’ve received any unusual messages or calls claiming to be from the bank?

Customer: Yes, actually. I got a call yesterday from someone claiming to be from [Bank Name] asking me to approve the payment manually. I didn’t give them any details, though.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. It sounds like the fraudsters are actively trying to bypass our systems. I’ll add an alert to your account so our team can monitor for further suspicious activity. If you receive any more unexpected calls or messages, please report them to us immediately.

Customer: I will. Thank you for taking this seriously.

Advisor: To summarize, your payment was blocked because the account details provided are linked to potential fraud. I’ve secured your online banking by resetting your credentials, flagged unauthorized transactions, and recommended enabling two-factor authentication. I’ve also advised you to verify the exchange details independently and report the broker to Action Fraud. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, that’s everything. Thanks for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Jenkins. Thank you for contacting us promptly. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. Take care.

Customer: Thanks, you too.
