Customer: Yes, it’s Sophie Collins.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Collins. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 29th October 1993, and my postcode is NE1 4ST.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I applied for a job online, and they asked for my banking details to set up payroll. But now my paycheck hasn’t come through, and I’m seeing transactions I didn’t authorize. I think they used my details to steal money.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Collins. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you found this job and what happened?

Customer: I found the job on a recruitment website. It seemed legitimate, and the company had a professional-looking website. They offered me the role quickly after an online interview and asked for my bank details to set up direct deposit for my salary.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any documents, such as an offer letter or contract?

Customer: Yes, they sent an offer letter and employment contract. It all looked real, so I didn’t suspect anything.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you notice something was wrong?

Customer: I was supposed to get paid last Friday, but nothing came through. Then, yesterday, I saw a £3,000 transfer and some smaller payments leaving my account. I didn’t authorize any of it.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Collins. I’ve identified the £3,000 transfer you mentioned, along with several other unauthorized transactions, including £1,500 to a flagged account and smaller purchases totaling £800. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite childhood book?”

Customer: It’s Harry Potter.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 2987.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the job further. Did the company request any additional personal information, such as your ID or login credentials?

Customer: Yes, they asked for a copy of my passport and a utility bill to verify my identity.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs to commit further crimes, such as opening accounts or applying for credit. Did they send you any follow-up emails or make other requests?

Customer: Yes, after I sent my details, they asked me to pay a “processing fee” for onboarding. I refused, but I’m worried they used my information for something else.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Collins. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. I’ve also flagged additional suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for my email and a shopping site.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Collins. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
