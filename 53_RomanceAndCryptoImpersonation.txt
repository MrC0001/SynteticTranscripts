Customer: Yes, it’s Eleanor Hughes.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Hughes. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 22nd March 1992, and my postcode is CV4 7AL.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who claimed to be a cryptocurrency investor. He convinced me to send money to his “secure wallet” for investments, but now I can’t reach him, and my account shows payments I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Hughes. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app three months ago. He said he was a financial expert and could help me grow my savings. He seemed so knowledgeable and kind, and we talked every day.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunity did he introduce you to, and how did you start?

Customer: He told me about a crypto trading platform that only experienced investors used. He guided me through setting up an account and asked me to transfer an initial amount.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial transfer, and how was the payment made?

Customer: I sent £2,000 directly from my account to the wallet address he provided. He showed me screenshots of how the investment was growing.

Advisor: Understood. How much did you invest in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over the last three months, I’ve invested around £35,000. At first, I transferred money from my account, but then he had me buy cryptocurrency and send it directly to his wallet.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or evidence of your growing investment?

Customer: Yes, he sent monthly statements showing profits, and he even showed me his own account as proof.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: Last week, I tried to withdraw my funds, and he said there was a “release fee” of £10,000. That’s when I refused, and now he’s disappeared. I also noticed payments on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Hughes. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see multiple unauthorized transactions. These include a £4,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency platform, £3,000 to a flagged account, and several smaller payments. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite book?”

Customer: It’s Pride and Prejudice.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4782.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the cryptocurrency platform he mentioned. Did you access it directly, or did he manage the account for you?

Customer: He managed everything. I only sent the money, and he sent me updates on the progress.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he request any personal identification, such as a passport or utility bill?

Customer: Yes, he said he needed my ID for account verification, so I sent him a copy of my passport.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs for further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did he ask you to download any apps or software?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “SecureTrade” to monitor my investment. It seemed legitimate at the time.

Advisor: Understood. It’s possible that app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Hughes. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from a foreign IP address. Have you traveled recently or shared your login credentials with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing future risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to the cryptocurrency platform you used. They may be able to help track the transactions. Would you like advice on how to proceed with them?

Customer: Yes, that would be great.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed steps in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your ID has likely been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security, contacting the crypto platform, and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Hughes. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
