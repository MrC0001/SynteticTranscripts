Customer: Yes, it’s Jennifer Clarke.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Clarke. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 10th June 1989, and my postcode is M3 4JN.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to invest in a new cryptocurrency platform. It seemed legitimate at first, but now I can’t withdraw my money. On top of that, I’ve noticed other transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Clarke. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by telling me how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app about four months ago. He said he was a financial consultant working in cryptocurrency and wanted to help me build a secure financial future. We started chatting every day, and he seemed so knowledgeable and genuine.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunity did he present to you, and how did you begin the process?

Customer: He told me about an exclusive cryptocurrency platform that used AI to guarantee high returns. He guided me through setting up an account on the platform and asked me to make an initial deposit.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial deposit, and how were the payments made?

Customer: My first deposit was £1,000, which I paid using my debit card. He showed me how the balance grew within a few days, so I felt encouraged to invest more.

Advisor: Understood. How much did you invest in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over three months, I invested nearly £40,000. Initially, I used my debit card, but he later convinced me to transfer money directly to a bank account and buy cryptocurrency to send to a wallet address he provided.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or evidence to support his claims, such as account statements or proof of your growing investment?

Customer: Yes, he sent me screenshots of my account balance increasing and emailed me monthly statements. It all looked very professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start suspecting something might be wrong?

Customer: About a week ago. I tried to withdraw some of my money, but the platform said I needed to pay a £5,000 “tax clearance fee” first. When I questioned it, he reassured me, but I refused to pay. After that, he stopped responding, and now I can’t access the platform at all.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like this was a sophisticated investment scam. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions on your account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw several transactions I didn’t recognize, including a £2,500 transfer and £1,800 in online purchases.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Clarke. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There’s also a £3,000 transfer to a flagged cryptocurrency wallet and two additional smaller payments totaling £700. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite book?”

Customer: It’s Pride and Prejudice.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 6743.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s talk about the individual you were speaking with. Did he request any personal identification documents, such as copies of your passport or driver’s license?

Customer: Yes, he asked for my passport and a utility bill for “verification purposes.”

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities for further crimes, such as opening accounts or applying for loans. Did he ask you to download any apps or software during this process?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “CryptoSecure” to track my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Did you receive any emails or texts asking you to verify your online banking details or provide one-time passcodes around the time of the unauthorized transactions?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying my account was under review and asking me to log in to verify my information. I clicked the link and entered my details.

Advisor: Thank you. It sounds like the email was part of a phishing attempt designed to capture your credentials. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking site?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Clarke. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from overseas. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so embarrassed for falling for this.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Clarke. Romance and investment scams are designed to exploit trust and emotions. Moving forward, I recommend verifying the identity of anyone you meet online who requests financial help. For example, you can use reverse image searches to check if their photos are linked to other profiles. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll be more careful in the future.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance with setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Clarke. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
