Customer: Yes, it’s Tom Edwards.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 22nd February 1991, and my postcode is CB1 1AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been talking to someone online who convinced me to invest in cryptocurrency. I sent the money, but now I can’t access the account they set up for me, and I’ve noticed some strange transactions in my bank account.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Edwards. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you met this person and what they promised?

Customer: I met her on a dating app about three months ago. She seemed very knowledgeable about crypto and said she’d help me invest. She showed me screenshots of her earnings and convinced me to transfer money to her “investment platform.”

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you transfer, and how were the payments made?

Customer: Altogether, I’ve sent about £20,000 over five transactions. I transferred the money directly from my account to the account details she provided.

Advisor: Understood. Did she provide any documentation or login details for the investment account?

Customer: Yes, she sent me a link to the platform and a username and password. The account initially showed my balance growing, but now I can’t log in, and she’s stopped responding.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you noticed any unauthorized activity in your bank account besides these transfers?

Customer: Yes, there was a £5,000 transfer yesterday and some smaller payments I didn’t recognize.

Advisor: Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Edwards. I’ve identified the £20,000 you mentioned, as well as the £5,000 transfer and smaller payments totaling £1,200. Do you recognize any of these additional transactions?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite sport?”

Customer: It’s rugby.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4736.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the investment platform further. Did the website or app they provided seem legitimate or have any security features?

Customer: It looked professional and had graphs showing my earnings. But now that I can’t log in, I’m realizing it might have been fake.

Advisor: Thank you. Did she create any urgency or pressure for you to make the transfers quickly?

Customer: Yes, she said there was a time-sensitive opportunity with high returns and that I needed to act fast.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any notifications from the bank about new devices or changes to your account after making these transfers?

Customer: Yes, I got a text about a new device logging in, but I thought it was just part of the platform setup.

Advisor: Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Edwards. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. I’ve also flagged and removed several suspicious payees. Have you reused your account credentials on other platforms?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for my email and a couple of online subscriptions.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Edwards. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
