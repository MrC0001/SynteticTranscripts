Customer: Yes, it’s Christopher Mills.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Mills. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 15th November 1990, and my postcode is B32 4LN.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I invested in a cryptocurrency platform I found online. At first, it looked like my balance was growing, but when I tried to withdraw, they said I needed to pay a fee. I refused, and now the site is gone. On top of that, I’ve noticed transactions on my account I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Mills. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this step by step. Could you start by explaining how you found this platform?

Customer: I saw an ad on a social media site claiming it was endorsed by a celebrity. The ad said it was a limited-time opportunity to invest in a new cryptocurrency. I clicked the link, and it took me to a professional-looking website.

Advisor: Thank you. What happened after you visited the website? Did you sign up for an account?

Customer: Yes, I created an account, and someone from the platform called me almost immediately. They introduced themselves as an account manager and walked me through the process of making my first deposit.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial deposit, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: My first deposit was £750, which I paid using my debit card. They showed me how my account balance started growing, so I felt confident to invest more.

Advisor: Understood. How much have you invested in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over three months, I invested about £20,000. At first, I used my debit card, but they later had me transfer money directly to a bank account. They also convinced me to purchase cryptocurrency and send it to their wallet.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any documentation or account statements to support their claims about your growing balance?

Customer: Yes, they sent me statements showing my balance increasing and even emailed screenshots of my account activity.

Advisor: I understand. When did you realize something was wrong?

Customer: A week ago. I tried to withdraw my funds, and they said I needed to pay a £3,000 “release fee.” That’s when I became suspicious and refused to pay. Now the site is gone, and the account manager has blocked me.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions on your bank account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw a £1,200 transfer and some smaller payments to online retailers. I didn’t make any of them.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Mills. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There’s also a £2,500 transfer to a flagged account and a £3,000 payment to a cryptocurrency exchange. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those were me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What was the name of your first school?”

Customer: It’s Oakwood Primary.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4928.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the platform you used. Did they ask for any personal identification documents, such as a copy of your passport or a utility bill?

Customer: Yes, they asked for my passport to verify my account, and I sent it to them.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen identities to commit further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did they ask you to download any apps or software during the process?

Customer: Yes, they had me install an app called “CryptoTracker” to monitor my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s great. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions. Did you receive any emails or texts asking you to verify your banking credentials or provide one-time passcodes?

Customer: Yes, I got an email saying my account was suspended due to unusual activity and asking me to log in to resolve it. I clicked the link and entered my details.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s likely the email was part of a phishing attack. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical, so I didn’t question it.

Advisor: I understand. Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Mills. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from abroad. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone else?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ve blocked these devices from future access and included these details in our investigation. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance on avoiding scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for falling for this.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Mr. Mills. These scams are designed to exploit trust and appear highly professional. Moving forward, always verify investment platforms by checking their registration with financial authorities. Would you like me to send you a guide on identifying legitimate platforms?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, I think that’s a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on avoiding similar scams and protecting your identity in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Mills. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
