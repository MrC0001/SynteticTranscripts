Customer: Yes, it’s Daniel Moore.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Moore. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 17th August 1979, and my postcode is B5 6AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my business account has been hacked. I was contacted by someone claiming to be from a charity we work with, asking for a donation. We sent the money, but now I’ve noticed more transactions I didn’t authorize, and my account seems to have been accessed by someone else.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Moore. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the charity contacted you and what they requested?

Customer: They sent an email that looked like it was from one of the charities we support. It mentioned an urgent campaign for disaster relief and provided account details for the donation.

Advisor: Thank you. How much did you send, and how was the payment made?

Customer: I sent £5,000 via bank transfer. The email looked legitimate, and we’ve supported similar campaigns before.

Advisor: Understood. Did the email address match the charity’s usual contact details, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked right at first, but when I checked later, I noticed the domain had an extra hyphen in it.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often create lookalike email domains to impersonate trusted organizations. Have you noticed any other unusual activity, such as alerts about new devices or additional payments?

Customer: Yes, there are payments to accounts I don’t recognize, and I received an email about a new login from an IP address overseas.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Moore. I’ve identified the £5,000 payment you mentioned, along with several unauthorized transactions. These include a £7,500 transfer to a flagged account, £3,000 to a cryptocurrency platform, and smaller payments totaling £2,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first school?”

Customer: It’s St. Mary’s Primary.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 2489.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the charity email further. Did it include any urgency or additional requests to make the payment seem critical?

Customer: Yes, it mentioned that the donation was time-sensitive and needed to be processed within 24 hours to help with emergency relief efforts.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in charity scams. Did the email include any attachments or links?

Customer: Yes, there was a PDF attachment with the campaign details and a link to “verify” the donation process.

Advisor: Understood. Did you interact with the link or the attachment?

Customer: I opened the attachment, but I didn’t click the link.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Moore. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from an international IP address. I’ve also flagged additional suspicious payees and removed them. Have you reused your banking credentials on any other platforms or shared them with anyone recently?

Customer: Yes, I use the same password for some business management tools.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or reused credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Would you like assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions on securing your account and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend implementing dual authorization for large payments in your business processes to prevent similar incidents. Would you like guidance on how to set that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report and business accounts for unusual activity, as your details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on how to monitor your credit and secure your business accounts?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and implementing fraud prevention measures for your business. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Moore. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
