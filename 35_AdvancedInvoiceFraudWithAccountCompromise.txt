Customer: Yes, it’s Sarah Mitchell.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Mitchell. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th May 1986, and my postcode is NW3 5TY.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I’m the finance manager for a company, and we recently paid an invoice from one of our suppliers. But now they’re saying they didn’t send it, and the payment went to the wrong account. I also can’t access my online banking anymore.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Mitchell. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the invoice?

Customer: The invoice came through email, just like all our others. It looked completely normal, with the same layout and details as previous invoices from this supplier.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your supplier’s usual address, or did you notice any small differences?

Customer: At first glance, it matched. But after this happened, I checked again, and there’s an extra “i” in the domain name. I didn’t notice it before.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often create lookalike email addresses to impersonate legitimate senders. Did the invoice mention any changes to the supplier’s usual payment details?

Customer: Yes, it said their account had changed due to an internal audit and provided new bank details.

Advisor: Thank you. How much was the payment, and how was it made?

Customer: It was £85,000, transferred directly through our business online banking system.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review the payment details and check for any other suspicious activity on your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged in our system for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from devices not previously associated with your account. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I had no idea. What does that mean?

Advisor: It suggests that your online banking credentials may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Max.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 8237.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the email you received. Did it include any urgency, such as warnings about late fees or account suspension if the payment wasn’t processed immediately?

Customer: Yes, it said the payment needed to be made within 24 hours to avoid a late fee. That’s why I acted quickly.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic used in invoice fraud to bypass verification processes. Did the email include any attachments, such as the invoice itself or supporting documents?

Customer: Yes, it included the invoice and a document showing the supposed account change authorization.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often include forged documents to appear legitimate. Did you attempt to verify the account change with your supplier before making the payment?

Customer: No, I didn’t. The email seemed so legitimate, and we’ve been working with this supplier for years.

Advisor: Thank you. Let’s discuss the login attempts I mentioned earlier. Have you received any emails or texts recently asking you to verify your online banking credentials or provide a one-time passcode?

Customer: Yes, about a week ago I got a text saying there was suspicious activity on my account and asking me to log in to verify my details. I clicked the link and entered my information.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It’s likely the text was part of a phishing attack designed to capture your credentials. Did the website you were directed to resemble our online banking site?

Customer: Yes, it looked identical.

Advisor: I understand. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms to steal sensitive information. After entering your details, did you notice any unusual activity, such as failed login attempts or changes to your account settings?

Customer: No, everything seemed normal until this happened.

Advisor: Let me review your account for additional suspicious activity, including the flagged payment. Could you hold for a moment while I investigate further?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Mitchell. I’ve flagged the unauthorized payment and identified other suspicious transactions, including two new payees added to your account. I’ve blocked these accounts and initiated recovery requests for the funds. I’ll also include these details in our case notes for further investigation.

Customer: Thank you. What happens next?

Advisor: Our investigations team will work to recover the funds and assess the extent of the compromise. In the meantime, I recommend implementing additional security measures for your business, including reviewing your payment verification process. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, definitely.

Advisor: Let me provide some guidance to help prevent this from happening again. Invoice fraud often involves email compromise or spoofing. Moving forward, I recommend always verifying payment details with the supplier using a trusted phone number, especially if there are changes to their usual account details. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll make sure we do that from now on.

Advisor: Excellent. I also recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking and business email accounts to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, consider conducting regular cybersecurity training for your staff to help them recognize phishing attempts and suspicious activity. Would you like resources on that?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized payment, blocked suspicious accounts, and reset your online banking credentials. I’ve also initiated recovery processes for the funds and provided guidance on improving your company’s security measures. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Mitchell. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
