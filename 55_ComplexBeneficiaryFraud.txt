Customer: Yes, it’s Samantha Clarke.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Clarke. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 10th May 1990, and my postcode is M4 3AE.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got a letter saying my account is under review because I might be involved in fraud, but I don’t understand what’s going on. I’ve also noticed some payments in and out of my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Clarke. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining when you first noticed something unusual?

Customer: It started about two weeks ago. I got a message from someone claiming to be from your bank, saying my account was used to receive a large payment, and they needed me to transfer it elsewhere to avoid penalties.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any additional details to make their claim seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they mentioned a £12,000 payment and gave me a reference number. They said it was urgent and that not acting could freeze my account.

Advisor: Understood. What instructions did they give you, and how did you proceed?

Customer: They asked me to transfer the funds to another account they provided. They even stayed on the phone with me while I made the transfer.

Advisor: I see. Did they ask for any additional information, such as your login credentials or a one-time passcode?

Customer: Yes, they said they needed to verify my identity, so I gave them the code I received via text.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like the fraudsters used a combination of tactics to access your account. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any other suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Clarke. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the payment you mentioned, along with several others that appear suspicious. There’s a £15,000 credit from an unknown source, followed by multiple outgoing transactions totaling £10,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, I don’t. I don’t know where that money came from or why it’s in my account.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite animal?”

Customer: It’s a dolphin.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 2783.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the initial contact. Did they use any urgency or threats to make you comply?

Customer: Yes, they said my account could be flagged for money laundering if I didn’t transfer the funds immediately.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating fear and urgency is a common tactic in beneficiary fraud. Did they provide any follow-up instructions or contact you again after the payment?

Customer: Yes, they called me the next day and asked for access to my account to “monitor for further issues.” That’s when I got suspicious and stopped responding.

Advisor: Understood. Did you notice any changes to your account settings, such as new payees being added or unfamiliar notifications?

Customer: I did see a notification about a new payee, but I assumed it was related to their instructions.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Let me review the payees and devices linked to your account for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Clarke. I’ve identified several unauthorized payees added to your account, including one linked to a flagged account where funds were transferred. I’ve also identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices. Have you shared your credentials with any third-party services recently?

Customer: No, but I did log into a website they directed me to for “verification.”

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the fraudsters used that website to capture your credentials. I recommend uninstalling any apps linked to your account and running a security scan on your devices. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your email security, as phishing attempts often originate from compromised accounts. Have you changed your email password recently?

Customer: No, I haven’t.

Advisor: I recommend doing that immediately and enabling two-factor authentication for your email as well. Lastly, I suggest monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen credentials can be used for identity theft. Would you like advice on how to do that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account and email security. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Clarke. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
