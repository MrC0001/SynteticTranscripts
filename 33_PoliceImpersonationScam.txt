Customer: Yes, it’s Mark Taylor.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 19th February 1977, and my postcode is SW6 3HJ.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I got a call yesterday from someone claiming to be a police officer. They said my account was at risk and convinced me to move my money to a “safe account.” Now I can’t access my funds, and I’m realizing this might have been a scam.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Taylor. You’ve taken the right step by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by telling me about the call you received?

Customer: The person said they were a detective from the fraud squad. They claimed someone had hacked into my account and that I needed to act quickly to protect my money.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any specific details to make their claim seem legitimate, such as mentioning transactions or using your personal information?

Customer: Yes, they mentioned a transaction of £1,200 to a foreign account. They also knew my full name and address, which made it seem real.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use stolen personal data to appear credible. What did they ask you to do next?

Customer: They told me to transfer my money to a “safe account” controlled by the police while they investigated. They said if I didn’t act quickly, I could lose everything.

Advisor: I see. How much did you transfer, and how was the payment made?

Customer: I transferred £25,000 in two payments. The first was through my online banking, and the second was through a branch when I couldn’t complete it online.

Advisor: Thank you. Did they provide any supporting documentation or evidence, such as emails or reference numbers, to back up their claims?

Customer: No, just their badge number and a supposed case reference. I didn’t think to verify it at the time.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. It sounds like this was a police impersonation scam. Let me review your recent transactions and cross-check the recipient accounts. Could you hold for a moment while I investigate?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Taylor. I’ve located the transactions, and they were sent to accounts flagged for fraudulent activity. I’ll initiate recall requests immediately. Before proceeding, I need to gather more details for our investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, absolutely.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the caller give you a number to call back, and if so, did you verify it independently?

Customer: They did give me a number, but I didn’t verify it. They said calling back would waste time because my account was at immediate risk.

Advisor: Understood. Creating urgency is a common tactic used by fraudsters to bypass skepticism. Did the caller mention or involve anyone else during the process, such as a colleague or a bank representative?

Customer: Yes, they said they were working with someone from my bank’s fraud team who would also be monitoring my account.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you receive any follow-up calls or messages after completing the transfers?

Customer: Yes, they called again to confirm the transfers and said the funds were now “secured.” That was the last time I heard from them.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s discuss your online banking account. Did you notice any changes, such as new payees being added or attempts to log in from unfamiliar devices?

Customer: No, everything looked normal until this morning when I tried to log in and saw that my account was restricted.

Advisor: Thank you. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account to facilitate the transfers. Let me check for any unusual activity or unauthorized devices linked to your account. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Sure.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Taylor. I’ve identified multiple login attempts from unfamiliar devices, including one from abroad. Have you traveled recently or shared your login details with anyone?

Customer: No, I haven’t traveled or shared my details.

Advisor: Thank you. This confirms unauthorized access. I’ll block these devices from future attempts and include these details in our case notes. Let’s focus on recovering the funds and securing your account further.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recall requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance to help you avoid scams like this in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so stupid for falling for it.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Mr. Taylor. Police impersonation scams are designed to exploit trust and create fear. Moving forward, always verify the identity of anyone claiming to be from law enforcement or your bank. For example, you can call the non-emergency police line or your bank directly using a trusted number. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance with setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Lastly, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as fraudsters may attempt identity theft using the information they’ve obtained. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Taylor. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
