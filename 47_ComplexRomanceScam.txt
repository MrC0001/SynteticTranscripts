Customer: Yes, it’s Sarah Collins.

Advisor: Thank you, Ms. Collins. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 12th July 1986, and my postcode is NG9 2DT.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I’ve been scammed. I met someone online who convinced me to invest in a cryptocurrency platform. They seemed so trustworthy, but now I can’t access the platform or my money, and I’ve noticed some transactions from my bank account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Ms. Collins. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s go through this step by step. Could you start by telling me how you met this individual?

Customer: We met on a dating app about five months ago. He told me he was a cryptocurrency trader and that he could help me grow my savings. We talked almost every day, and he seemed genuinely interested in helping me.

Advisor: Thank you. What kind of investment opportunity did he introduce you to, and how did you begin?

Customer: He told me about a trading platform that only serious investors use. He said it had an algorithm that guaranteed high returns. He guided me through setting up an account and asked me to make an initial deposit.

Advisor: I see. How much was your initial deposit, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: My first deposit was £1,500, which I paid using my debit card. He showed me how my account balance grew within days, so I felt confident investing more.

Advisor: Understood. How much did you invest in total, and did the payment methods change over time?

Customer: Over four months, I invested about £50,000. At first, I used my debit card, but later he convinced me to transfer money directly to a bank account and also to purchase cryptocurrency and send it to a wallet address he provided.

Advisor: Thank you. Did he provide any documentation or account statements to show your growing balance?

Customer: Yes, he sent me monthly statements and screenshots of my account showing profits. It all looked very professional.

Advisor: I understand. When did you start suspecting something was wrong?

Customer: About a week ago. I tried to withdraw some of my money, and the platform said I needed to pay a £10,000 “release fee.” I refused, and when I asked him about it, he stopped replying. Now I can’t log in to the platform.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. You also mentioned unauthorized transactions on your bank account. Could you tell me more about what you’ve noticed?

Customer: Yes, this morning I saw a £4,000 transfer to a cryptocurrency exchange and some smaller transactions for online purchases. I didn’t authorize any of them.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your recent transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Ms. Collins. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. There’s also a £3,500 transfer to another flagged account. Do you recognize these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll flag these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I’ll need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite holiday destination?”

Customer: It’s Greece.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 7291.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the individual you were speaking with. Did he request any personal identification, such as a passport or a utility bill?

Customer: Yes, he said he needed my ID to verify my trading account, so I sent him a copy of my passport.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use stolen IDs to commit further crimes, such as opening fake accounts. Did he ask you to download any apps or software as part of the process?

Customer: Yes, he had me install an app called “CryptoSecure” to track my investments.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the app may have compromised your device. I recommend uninstalling it immediately and running a full security scan. Do you have antivirus software installed?

Customer: Yes, I do.

Advisor: That’s good to hear. I’ve also removed the flagged devices from your account and included these details in our investigation notes. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, initiated recovery requests, and secured your account. While our investigations team works on recovering your funds, I’d like to provide guidance to help prevent this from happening again. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please. I feel so embarrassed for trusting him.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Ms. Collins. These scams are designed to appear legitimate and exploit trust. Moving forward, I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code for every login. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as stolen IDs are often used for identity theft. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Ms. Collins. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
