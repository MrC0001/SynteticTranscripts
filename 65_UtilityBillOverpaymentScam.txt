Customer: Yes, it’s James Turner.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Turner. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 7th July 1980, and my postcode is EH8 9AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got a call from someone claiming to be from my utility company. They said I’d been overcharged on my energy bills and needed my account details to process a refund. Now, I’ve noticed some large payments I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Turner. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how the caller introduced themselves and what they said?

Customer: They said they were from my energy provider and had detected an overcharge on my bills for the last 12 months. They offered to refund the amount directly to my bank account.

Advisor: Thank you. What information did they request, and what steps did you follow?

Customer: They asked for my bank account number and sort code to “process the refund.” Then, they said they needed a one-time passcode to confirm the transaction.

Advisor: Understood. Did they provide any follow-up details or documentation to make their request seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they sent me an email with a refund confirmation and a case number. It all looked very official, so I didn’t suspect anything at first.

Advisor: Thank you. When did you realize something was wrong?

Customer: Yesterday, I noticed an alert about a £5,000 transfer I didn’t authorize, along with some smaller payments. I also got a notification about a new payee being added to my account.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Turner. I’ve identified the unauthorized transactions you mentioned, along with a £3,000 transfer to a flagged cryptocurrency exchange and several smaller payments. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite sport?”

Customer: It’s football.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 1296.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the call further. Did the caller use any urgency to pressure you into providing the information?

Customer: Yes, they said the refund would expire if I didn’t provide my details immediately. They also mentioned that delays could affect my credit score.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use urgency to bypass suspicion. Did they ask for any additional personal information, such as your ID or other verification details?

Customer: Yes, they asked for my date of birth and address to “confirm my account.” I gave it to them because they already seemed to know some of my details.

Advisor: Understood. Did you receive any further communication or follow-up requests after the initial call?

Customer: Yes, they sent a text message saying the refund was being processed and asked me to confirm by clicking a link. I didn’t click it, though.

Advisor: That’s good to know. Let me review the devices linked to your account and check for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Turner. I’ve identified several unauthorized devices linked to your account, including one from a foreign IP address. I’ve also flagged multiple new payees and removed them. Have you used your banking credentials on any other platforms or shared them with anyone recently?

Customer: No, but I reuse the same password for a couple of utility accounts.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through a data breach or phishing attack. I recommend updating your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Do you need help with that?

Customer: Yes, that would be great.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your account and linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend monitoring your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

Advisor: I’ll include that as well. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and monitoring your identity. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Turner. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
