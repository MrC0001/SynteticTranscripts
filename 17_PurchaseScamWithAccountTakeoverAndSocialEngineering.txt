Customer: Yes, it’s Daniel Edwards.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 5th January 1986, and the postcode is BS1 3AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I bought a laptop online from a classified ads site, but it never arrived. When I tried to contact the seller, they stopped responding. Then this morning, I noticed some transactions on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Edwards. Let me help you with this. We’ll investigate both the purchase and the unauthorized transactions. Could you start by telling me about the laptop purchase? How did you find the seller, and how did they communicate with you?

Customer: I found the ad on a classified website. The seller seemed friendly and said they were selling the laptop because they were upgrading. We communicated through email and text.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the seller provide any proof of the item, such as pictures, specifications, or receipts?

Customer: Yes, they sent pictures and said it was almost new. They even offered to show me a copy of the original purchase receipt, but I didn’t ask for it.

Advisor: Understood. And how did you make the payment?

Customer: They asked me to transfer £800 directly to their bank account because they didn’t want to deal with payment platforms. I thought it seemed reasonable at the time.

Advisor: I see. Did they provide a delivery timeline or tracking information after you sent the payment?

Customer: They said they’d send it the same day, but I didn’t get any tracking details. When I asked, they said they’d update me later, but then they stopped replying altogether.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you’ve described, it sounds like you’ve been targeted in a purchase scam. I’ll investigate the account you transferred the money to and also look into the unauthorized transactions you mentioned. Could you confirm when you first noticed the suspicious transactions?

Customer: It was this morning. I got a notification about a £1,200 transfer to a payee I don’t recognize. Then I saw another transaction for £500 to an online retailer.

Advisor: Thank you. Did you receive any emails, texts, or calls recently asking you to verify your banking details or provide any personal information?

Customer: Yes, I got a text yesterday claiming to be from the bank. It said there was unusual activity on my account and included a link to verify my details. I clicked the link and entered my login information.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like fraudsters may have gained access to your account through a phishing scam. I’ll secure your account immediately to prevent further unauthorized activity. Could you hold for a moment while I review your recent transactions?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Edwards. I’ve reviewed your account, and I can see the transactions you mentioned: £1,200 to a new payee and £500 to an online retailer. Additionally, there’s a pending payment for £800 to another new payee. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll flag all of these as unauthorized and block any further transactions to these accounts. Before I proceed, I’ll need to confirm some security details to reset your online banking credentials. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is the name of your first pet?”

Customer: It’s Max.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 7643.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your credentials now. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Let’s start with the phishing text you received. Did the sender’s phone number look unusual, or did it appear similar to our official number?

Customer: It looked like it came from the bank, but now I’m not sure.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often spoof legitimate numbers to make their messages seem authentic. Did the link in the text take you to a website that resembled our official site?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same.

Advisor: Understood. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate ones to capture sensitive information. After entering your details, did you notice any unusual activity on your account, such as failed login attempts or password changes?

Customer: No, everything seemed normal until this morning.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. It’s likely the fraudsters accessed your account overnight. Let’s discuss the next steps. I’ll escalate this case to our investigations team, who will work on recovering the unauthorized funds. While I handle that, could you confirm whether you’ve noticed any suspicious emails or texts since this incident?

Customer: No, nothing else so far.

Advisor: That’s good to know. I recommend monitoring your email and phone for any further phishing attempts, as fraudsters often target victims multiple times.

Advisor: I’ve secured your account, flagged the unauthorized transactions, and initiated a recovery process for the funds. While we proceed, I’d like to provide guidance on preventing similar scams in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Of course. Purchase scams often involve sellers asking for direct bank transfers, which provide little buyer protection. I recommend using secure payment platforms that offer dispute resolution. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does.

Advisor: Great. Additionally, phishing scams often use urgent or alarming messages to trick you into providing personal information. Always double-check links and contact us directly if you’re unsure about a message. Would you like me to send you a guide on recognizing phishing scams?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number, which you can share with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, blocked further fraudulent activity, and reset your online banking credentials. I’ve also initiated the recovery process for your funds and provided guidance on avoiding scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Edwards. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
