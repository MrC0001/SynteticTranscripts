Customer: Yes, it’s David Clarke.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Clarke. Can you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 16th March 1977, and the postcode is E17 8JR.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me why you’re calling today?

Customer: I think I’ve been scammed. I was trying to get a loan online, and I paid some fees upfront, but now the company has disappeared, and I can’t get through to anyone.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Clarke. Let me gather more details so we can assist you. Could you start by telling me how you came across this loan company?

Customer: I found their website while searching online for loans. They promised quick approval and low interest rates.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the website look professional, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked professional at the time. They had forms to fill out, and everything seemed legitimate.

Advisor: I see. Did they ask you for any documentation or additional details before requesting the fees?

Customer: They asked for my ID and proof of income, which I sent over email. Then they said I needed to pay a processing fee before the loan could be approved.

Advisor: Thank you for clarifying. How much was the processing fee, and how did you make the payment?

Customer: The first fee was £250, which I paid via bank transfer. Then they asked for another £500, claiming it was for “insurance” on the loan.

Advisor: I see. Did they provide any documentation or receipts for these payments?

Customer: They emailed me a receipt for the first payment but didn’t send anything after the second one.

Advisor: Understood. And when you tried to follow up with them, what happened?

Customer: I called the number on their website, but it goes straight to voicemail. Their email also bounced back when I tried to contact them.

Advisor: Thank you for sharing that. Based on what you’ve described, this appears to be an advance fee scam, where fraudsters pose as loan providers to collect upfront payments. I’ll take immediate steps to secure your account and investigate these transactions. Could you hold for a moment while I review your recent activity?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Clarke. I’ve located the transactions to the account you mentioned. I’ll flag these payments as potentially fraudulent. Before proceeding, could you confirm the details of the account you sent the money to?

Customer: Yes, the sort code was 20-18-15, and the account number was 87345621.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll cross-check this against our internal fraud database. This may take a few minutes. Could you hold again?

Customer: Sure, no problem.

Advisor: Thanks for waiting, Mr. Clarke. The account you sent the funds to is flagged in our system as being associated with multiple reports of fraud. This confirms that you’ve been targeted in a scam. I’ll escalate this case to our investigations team and initiate a recovery request. Before proceeding further, could you answer a few additional questions to complete the investigation?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thank you. Have you shared any other personal or financial information with this company, such as your bank details or passwords?

Customer: No, just the documents they requested and the payments I made.

Advisor: Understood. Have you received any other suspicious emails, texts, or calls recently, especially ones asking for additional payments or information?

Customer: No, just from this company. But they did mention that there might be “additional administrative costs” if the loan was delayed.

Advisor: Thank you. Fraudsters often use tactics like that to extract more money. Have you contacted any other loan companies during your search, or was this the only one?

Customer: This was the only one. I didn’t apply anywhere else.

Advisor: That’s helpful to know. I’ll ensure that this information is included in the case notes. Let’s take additional steps to secure your account. I’ll set up enhanced fraud monitoring, reset your online banking credentials, and block any further transactions to the flagged account. Does that sound okay?

Customer: Yes, please do that.

Advisor: I’ll handle that now. While I’m processing these changes, I’d like to explain the next steps and provide some guidance to avoid similar scams in the future. Would that be helpful?

Customer: Yes, definitely.

Advisor: Great. First, let’s talk about how these scams typically operate. Fraudsters create fake websites or ads to attract people looking for loans, offering terms that seem too good to be true. They often request upfront payments for processing, insurance, or other fake charges. Once they receive the money, they disappear. Does this align with your experience?

Customer: Yes, it does. I feel so stupid for trusting them.

Advisor: Please don’t blame yourself, Mr. Clarke. These scams are designed to be convincing, and many people fall victim to them. The important thing is that you’ve reported it, and we’re taking action to protect you. Moving forward, I recommend always verifying the legitimacy of loan providers. Look for reviews on independent platforms and ensure they’re registered with the Financial Conduct Authority. Would you like me to send you guidance on how to spot fraudulent loan offers?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll arrange that. Additionally, I recommend reporting this scam to Action Fraud, the UK’s national fraud reporting centre. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and they’ll provide you with a reference number. You can share this with us for our investigation.

Customer: Okay, I’ll do that.

Advisor: Great. Lastly, I recommend keeping an eye on your account for any unusual activity. If you notice anything suspicious, please contact us immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Clarke. To summarize, I’ve flagged the fraudulent transactions, initiated a recovery request, and provided steps to improve your security. Our investigations team will keep you updated. If you need further assistance, don’t hesitate to call us again. Thank you for contacting us, and take care.

Customer: Thank you, Victoria. I appreciate your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome. Have a good day.
