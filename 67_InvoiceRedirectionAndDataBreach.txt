Customer: Yes, it’s Matthew Carter.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Carter. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 5th June 1982, and my postcode is NW3 6LP.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: My company has been targeted by fraud. We paid an invoice that seemed legitimate, but our supplier says they never received the payment. Now, I’m worried my account may have been compromised because I’ve noticed some unusual logins and transactions.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear that, Mr. Carter. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining how you received the invoice and what happened?

Customer: The invoice came through email, just like all our usual invoices from this supplier. It referenced our last order and had all the correct details, except for updated payment instructions. We paid £75,000 to the new account they provided.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your supplier’s usual contact, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked identical to their usual address, but when we checked more closely later, we noticed the domain had an extra letter in it.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often create lookalike email addresses to impersonate legitimate senders. Did you attempt to verify the payment instructions with your supplier before transferring the funds?

Customer: No, we didn’t. The email seemed so genuine, and we were in a rush to process payments.

Advisor: I see. Have you noticed any other unusual activity, such as alerts about new devices or additional transactions?

Customer: Yes, I got an email about a new login from an unfamiliar device, and there are several payments on my account that I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Let me review your account for these transactions and investigate further. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve located the payment you mentioned, and I can see several other unauthorized transactions. These include a £10,000 transfer to a flagged account, £5,000 to a cryptocurrency exchange, and smaller purchases totaling £2,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. Before proceeding, I need to verify some additional details to secure your account. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your mother’s maiden name?”

Customer: It’s Bennett.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 3746.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s discuss the email further. Did it include any urgency or warnings about penalties for late payment?

Customer: Yes, it said the invoice was overdue and that further delays could incur additional fees.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency is a common tactic in invoice scams to bypass verification processes. Did the email include any attachments or links?

Customer: Yes, there was an attachment for the invoice and a link to “verify” the updated payment details.

Advisor: Understood. Did you interact with the link or the attachment?

Customer: I opened the attachment to review the invoice but didn’t click the link.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review the devices and payees linked to your account for further suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, go ahead.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Carter. I’ve identified several unauthorized payees added to your account, including the flagged accounts where funds were transferred. I’ve also flagged multiple login attempts from international IP addresses. Have you shared your credentials with any third-party services or noticed any recent data breaches?

Customer: No, but I did receive an email from a business software provider last month about a data breach.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s possible the fraudsters accessed your account through compromised credentials. I recommend updating all your passwords immediately and enabling two-factor authentication. Do you need assistance with that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll send you guidance on securing your accounts and reviewing linked services. Let’s focus on recovering your funds and minimizing further risks.

Advisor: I recommend enabling two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you detailed instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend implementing dual authorization for large transactions in your company’s payment process to prevent similar incidents. Would you like guidance on how to set that up?

Customer: Yes, that would be very helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your account security and implementing fraud prevention measures for your business. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Carter. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
