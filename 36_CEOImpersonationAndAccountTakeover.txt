
Advisor: Hello, you’re through to the Fraud Department at [Bank Name]. My name is Rachel. Can I take your full name to start with, please?

Customer: Yes, it’s Jonathan Edwards.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Edwards. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 27th August 1983, and my postcode is E14 5AB.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I think my business has been targeted in a scam. I got an email from someone pretending to be my CEO, instructing me to make a payment for an urgent deal. I made the payment, but now I can’t access my online banking, and I’ve noticed other transactions I didn’t authorize.

Advisor: I’m sorry to hear that, Mr. Edwards. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by telling me about the email you received?

Customer: The email looked like it was from my CEO. It used his name and signature and referenced a legitimate project we’ve been working on. It said I needed to transfer £100,000 to secure a time-sensitive deal.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email address match your CEO’s usual address, or was there anything unusual about it?

Customer: It looked identical at first, but when I checked again after the payment, I realized the domain name was slightly different—just one letter was off.

Advisor: Understood. Fraudsters often use lookalike email addresses to impersonate senior executives. What instructions were given for the payment, and how did you complete it?

Customer: The email included bank details for the payment and asked me to confirm once it was done. I transferred the money using our business online banking account.

Advisor: Thank you. Did the email include any supporting documents, such as contracts or agreements, to add legitimacy?

Customer: Yes, it included a document that looked like a purchase agreement for the deal.

Advisor: Understood. Let me review your recent transactions and check for any other suspicious activity. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Edwards. I’ve located the payment, and it was sent to an account flagged for fraudulent activity. Additionally, I see multiple login attempts to your online banking from devices not previously associated with your account. Were you aware of this?

Customer: No, I wasn’t. What does that mean?

Advisor: It suggests that your account credentials may have been compromised. Before proceeding, I need to secure your account and block any unauthorized access. Could you confirm the answer to your security question: “What is your favorite sports team?”

Customer: It’s Manchester United.

Advisor: Thank you. Could you also confirm the last four digits of your business debit card?

Customer: It’s 1924.

Advisor: Perfect. I’ll reset your online banking credentials now and secure your account. While I do that, I’d like to ask a few more questions to assist with the investigation. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: Let’s go back to the email. Did it include any urgency, such as warnings about losing the deal if the payment wasn’t processed immediately?

Customer: Yes, it said the deal was confidential and had to be completed within 24 hours.

Advisor: Thank you. Creating urgency and confidentiality are common tactics in CEO impersonation scams. After you completed the payment, did you receive any follow-up messages from the fraudster?

Customer: Yes, they emailed again to confirm receipt and said they’d contact me later with updates on the deal. I didn’t hear from them after that.

Advisor: Understood. Let’s discuss the unauthorized transactions I mentioned earlier. Have you noticed any emails or texts asking you to verify your account or provide one-time passcodes recently?

Customer: Yes, about a week ago, I got a text saying there was unusual activity on my account and asking me to confirm my details. I clicked the link and logged in.

Advisor: Thank you for mentioning that. It’s likely the text was part of a phishing attack designed to capture your credentials. Did the website you were directed to resemble our banking platform?

Customer: Yes, it looked exactly the same, so I didn’t think twice.

Advisor: I understand. Phishing sites are designed to mimic legitimate platforms. After you entered your details, did you notice any unusual activity, such as failed login attempts or changes to your account settings?

Customer: No, everything seemed fine until I realized I couldn’t access my account this morning.

Advisor: Let me check for additional suspicious activity on your account and review the devices linked to recent login attempts. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, that’s fine.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Edwards. I’ve identified multiple unauthorized transactions, including a £25,000 transfer to a flagged account, a £15,000 payment to a cryptocurrency exchange, and two smaller transfers totaling £5,000. Do you recognize any of these?

Customer: No, none of those are mine.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ve flagged these as unauthorized and blocked any further transactions to the associated accounts. I’ll also initiate recovery requests for the funds and include these details in our investigation notes.

Advisor: Let’s focus on preventing further unauthorized access. I recommend implementing two-factor authentication for your online banking account to add an extra layer of security. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll send you instructions for that. Additionally, I recommend reviewing your company’s payment authorization processes. For example, implementing dual authorization for high-value payments can prevent these types of scams. Does that make sense?

Customer: Yes, it does. I’ll bring this up with my team.

Advisor: Excellent. I also recommend conducting regular cybersecurity training for your staff to help them recognize phishing attempts and suspicious activity. Would you like resources on that?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: I’ll include that in the guidance I send. Lastly, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide a reference number for your case, which you can share with us.

Customer: Okay, I’ll contact them today.

Advisor: Let me summarize the steps we’ve taken so far. I’ve flagged the unauthorized transactions, reset your online banking credentials, and initiated recovery processes for your funds. I’ve also provided guidance on improving your company’s security measures and avoiding similar scams in the future. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Edwards. Thank you for reporting this promptly. Take care, and have a good day.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
