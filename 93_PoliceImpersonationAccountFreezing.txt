Customer: Hi, it’s Robert Collins.

Advisor: Thank you, Mr. Collins. Could you also confirm your date of birth and the postcode linked to your account?

Customer: Sure. My date of birth is 7th October 1976, and my postcode is GU1 3AA.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. Let me access your account. Could you tell me what’s prompted you to contact us today?

Customer: I got a call earlier today from someone claiming to be a police officer. They said my bank account was being used for money laundering, and I needed to transfer all my money into a “secure account” to protect it. I think I’ve made a terrible mistake.

Advisor: I’m very sorry to hear this, Mr. Collins. Let me assure you, you’ve done the right thing by contacting us now. Let’s investigate this thoroughly. Could you start by explaining what the caller said and how they convinced you to act?

Customer: The caller introduced himself as an officer from the fraud division. He said there had been suspicious activity on my account and that it might be involved in a criminal investigation. I was so scared, I just did what he told me.

Advisor: I understand. Did they provide any credentials, like a badge number or case reference, to make the call seem legitimate?

Customer: Yes, they gave me a badge number and even told me to hang up and call 999 to verify. I did, but I think they kept the line open because I was connected straight back to them.

Advisor: That’s a common tactic fraudsters use. Could you confirm how much money you transferred and the method you used?

Customer: I transferred £25,000 to the account they gave me. They said it was a secure account to hold my funds until the investigation was over.

Advisor: Thank you for explaining. Did they ask for any other personal information, such as your bank login details or security codes?

Customer: Yes, they asked for my online banking login and the verification codes that were sent to my phone.

Advisor: Thank you. Let me review your account for any suspicious activity and take immediate action to secure it. Could you hold for a moment?

Customer: Yes, of course.

Advisor: Thanks for holding, Mr. Collins. I’ve identified the £25,000 transfer you mentioned, along with two additional payment attempts that were blocked by our system. There’s also evidence of unauthorized devices accessing your account. Do you recognize any payments to a “Global Secure Trust”?

Customer: No, that’s not familiar to me.

Advisor: Thank you for confirming. I’ll block further transactions to the associated accounts and reset your online banking credentials immediately. Could you confirm the last four digits of your debit card?

Customer: It’s 4537.

Advisor: Thank you. I’ll secure your account now and ensure no further unauthorized activity can occur. While I do that, let’s discuss the steps we can take to recover your funds and protect your account. Is that okay?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: First, I recommend reporting this incident to Action Fraud. Their website is actionfraud.police.uk, and their phone number is 0300 123 2040. They’ll provide you with a reference number, which you can share with us for follow-up.

Customer: I’ll contact them as soon as we’re done here.

Advisor: That’s great. I’ve also flagged your account for an internal investigation. While we can’t guarantee recovery, we’ll work with the receiving bank to attempt to retrieve the funds. This process can take some time, but we’ll keep you updated.

Customer: Thank you. What else should I do to protect myself?

Advisor: Let’s enable two-factor authentication on your account for added security. This ensures that even if someone has your login credentials, they can’t access your account without a verification code. Would you like assistance setting that up?

Customer: Yes, please.

Advisor: I’ll include detailed instructions in the follow-up email. Additionally, I recommend updating your passwords for both your online banking and email accounts. Have you used the same password across multiple platforms?

Customer: Yes, I think I have.

Advisor: I’ll include guidance on creating unique, secure passwords and suggest using a password manager to help you manage them. It’s also a good idea to monitor your credit report for unusual activity, as your personal details may have been compromised. Would you like advice on signing up for a credit monitoring service?

Customer: Yes, that would be helpful.

Advisor: Let’s also review how to identify and avoid scams like this in the future. Genuine police officers will never ask you to transfer money or share security codes. They also won’t contact you directly about ongoing investigations. Did the caller use any high-pressure tactics to convince you to act quickly?

Customer: Yes, they said the funds would be frozen if I didn’t act immediately, and I’d be held responsible if the account was used for illegal activities.

Advisor: That’s a classic scare tactic used by fraudsters. Always take the time to verify any claims by contacting organizations directly using their official contact details. I’ll include tips in the follow-up email on how to verify calls and protect yourself.

Customer: Thank you. I’ll definitely be more careful from now on.

Advisor: Before we wrap up, let me summarize the steps we’ve taken. I’ve secured your account by resetting your credentials and blocking further transactions. I’ve flagged the fraudulent activity for an internal investigation and provided guidance on contacting Action Fraud. I’ve also recommended enabling two-factor authentication, updating your passwords, and monitoring your credit report. Lastly, I’ll send tips on recognizing scams and staying safe online. Do you have any other questions or concerns?

Customer: No, that covers everything. Thank you so much for your help.

Advisor: You’re welcome, Mr. Collins. Thank you for reporting this promptly. If you have any further concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care.

Customer: Thanks. You too.
